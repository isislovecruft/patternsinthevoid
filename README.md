Patterns in the Void
====================

This is a mirror of the source code for generating the blog at
[Patterns in the Void](https://blog.patternsinthevoid.net). It uses Pelican, a
Python static generator that doesn't suck.

because I hate licenses and generally don't know what I'm doing with them,
especially for something like this which is a mix of source code and prose.

The sources include some plugins, each one should say which license it is
released under.
