[![][]][]You don't have to have much of a theoretical understanding of
politics to understand that coercion is ethically wrong. Basically, the
argument goes like this: The creative and intellectual capacity of a
conscious agent is directly proportional to their available degrees of
freedom. Thus, the more options an individual has available to them, the
better they are able to operate. Coercion restricts degrees of freedom
by forcing the agent into a predetermined path of action. Anything which
unnecessarily restricts freedom by coercion is inefficient and a
detriment to the overall creative and intellectual capacity of the
species, and thereby is an existential risk to the species, and thereby
should be considered ethically wrong. The state does not ask the citizen
if they wish to be a citizen, it tells them so. There is no other
option, and thus the state is intrinsically coercive, and thus ethically
wrong.

In this day and age, it's probably going to take extremely responsible
use of high technology to guarantee the survival of humankind. We're not
going to be able to simply go back to being hunter-gatherers --
lackadaisically wonderful as that would be -- there's too many people,
and anyone who says over 6 billion need to die for their survival is an
egotistical, un-empathetic piece of shit. So we're stuck with
technology. And we and other species are stuck on this planet, for now,
so we need to also take care of it. But that technology bit: high
technology is best imagined, developed, and engineered by unfettered
minds. Thus, a highly technological anarchist society is the best
guarantee for humankind's survival. The state is killing us all.

Of course, you're free to disagree with me.
