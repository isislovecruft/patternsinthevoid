Since I believe in changing my name whenever I feel like it, I'm doing
so again. From here until I decide to do so yet again, my name is Isis
Agora Lovecruft in order to pay homage to H.P. Lovecraft, Ada Lovelace,
Agorism, and the really deep-down OCD-ish satisfaction that I get from
syllable repetition. Oh, and ["cruft" is hacker-speak][] for "extraneous
bullshit".

Also, because I'm not really writing about anything that matters, and I
haven't gotten a chance to say this yet: Janelle Monae is my hero. I
don't normally listen to pop, but the "Many Moons" music video caught
and kept my rapt attention. I'm not going to get all into analysing it,
but Monae manages to combine critiques of gender politics, race/class
relations, and state capitalism, with an aesthetic sense that *could
actually be called cool*, and, not to mention, hotter feet than Michael
Jackson on speed. Oh, and, as if this video weren't awesome already,
Janelle also included gender bending (check out that handsome tux), nods
to classic science fiction, and the theme of android/cyborg rights. Fuck
yeah!
