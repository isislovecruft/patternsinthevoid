<!-- "The great are only great because we are on our knees. Let us rise!"
     -Pierre Joseph Proudhon

    "I tell you frankly and openly, I am for force. I have already told Captain Schaack, "if they
use cannons against us, we shall use dynamite against them." I repeat that I am the enemy of the
"order" of today, and I repeat that, with all my powers, so long as breath remains in me, I shall
combat it. I declare again, frankly and openly, that I am in favor of using force. I have told
Captain Schaack, and I stand by it, "if you cannonade us, we shall dynamite you." You laugh! Perhaps
you think, "you'll throw no more bombs"; but let me assure you I die happy on the gallows, so confident
am I that the hundreds and thousands to whom I have spoken will remember my words; and when you
shall have hanged us, then - mark my words - they will do the bombthrowing! In this hope do I say to
you: I despise you. I despise your order, your laws, your force-propped authority. Hang me for it!"

-Louis Lingg, Haymarket Martyr, after being sentenced to death

    "Law never made man a whit more just; and by means of their respect for it, even the well disposed
are daily made agents of injustice."
`-Henry David Thoreau

    "If I can't dance I don't want to be part of your revolution."
    -Emma Goldma
    
    "The State is said by some to be a necessary evil; it must be made unnecessary."
    -Benjamin R. Tucker
    
    "When the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is
called 'The People's Stick.'"
-Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin

    "No theory, no ready-made system, no book that has ever been written will save the world.
I cleave to no system. I am a true seeker."
-Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin -->
