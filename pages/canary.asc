Hash: SHA512

As of the date below, I have never received any:

  * National Security Letter, of any type, for any purpose,
  * Personal requests from any law enforcement agency worldwide or
    corporate entity for backdoors in any software and/or hardware
    projects to which I currently am an active contributor, nor am I
    aware of other contributors to these projects having received such a
    request,
  * Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders of any type,
  * Subpoenas and/or search warrants accompanied by a gag order pursuant
    to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,

Nor have I received, nor am I aware of, occurences of any of the above,
with respect to any and all machines I operate, maintain, and/or develop
on within the Tor network, or for other members of the Tor community.

This statement will continue to be updated bi-annually.  It was inspired
by https://www.canarywatch.org/, and a plaintext version can be found at
https://fyb.patternsinthevoid.net/canary.asc.

The OpenPGP signature on this warrant canary has a pre-determined expiration
date that coincides with the date on which this canary will die.  If all goes
well, this canary will be renewed every year.  Effectively, this means
that if you can verify the validity of the signature below, then this warrant
canary is still going strong.
