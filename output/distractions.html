            <br>My apologies for the javascript on this page...it's 
            prettify.js for the syntax highlighting in code blocks.

<p>Q: Why are quantum physicists so poor at&nbsp;sex?</p>
<p>A: Because when they find the position, they can&#8217;t find the momentum,
and when they have the momentum, they can&#8217;t find the&nbsp;position.</p>
<p>Heisenberg went for a drive and got stopped by a traffic cop. The cop
asked, &#8220;Do you know how fast you were going?&#8221; Heisenberg replied, &#8220;No,
but I know where I&nbsp;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: How many theoretical physicists specializing in general relativity
does it take to change a light&nbsp;bulb?</p>
<p>A: Two. One to hold the bulb and one to rotate the&nbsp;universe.</p>
<p>There is this farmer who is having problems with his chickens. All of
the sudden, they are all getting very sick and he doesn&#8217;t know what is
wrong with them. After trying all conventional means, he calls a
biologist, a chemist, and a physicist to see if they can figure out what
is wrong. So the biologist looks at the chickens, examines them a bit,
and says he has no clue what could be wrong with them. Then the chemist
takes some tests and makes some measurements, but he can&#8217;t come to any
conclusions either. So the physicist tries. He stands there and looks at
the chickens for a long time without touching them or anything. Then all
of the sudden he starts scribbling away in a notebook. Finally, after
several gruesome calculations, he exclaims, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got it! But it only
works for spherical chickens in a&nbsp;vacuum.&#8217;</p>
<p>A student recognizes Einstein in a train and asks: Excuse me, professor,
but does New York stop at this&nbsp;train?</p>
<p>Researchers in Fairbanks Alaska announced last week that they have
discovered a superconductor which will operate at room&nbsp;temperature.</p>
<p>Psychopathic Physics&nbsp;Test:</p>
<p>Q: A shotgun shooting 12 pellets of 00 Buckshot weighing 4g leave the
barrel at 1125 fps. Assuming the average infant will absorb 127.3 f/lbs
before disintegrating, how many babies will the average blast cut
through (rounding off to the nearest whole&nbsp;number)?</p>
<p>A:&nbsp;eight.</p>
<p>Q: A 100 kg man is being swung by his entrails in a circle 16&#8217;in radius
at the rate of 1600 radians/sec. Find the tension in the man&#8217;s entrails
(ignoring the effects of&nbsp;gravity).</p>
<p>A: 65,024&nbsp;Newtons.</p>
<p>Q: A pagan priest attempts to vaporize a young virgin by placing her in
a flaming pit. Assuming the woman, weighing 120 lbs, is completely
composed of water, how much energy will he have to use to completely
vaporize&nbsp;her?</p>
<p>A: 130,000&nbsp;<span class="caps">BTU</span></p>
<p>Q: An infant has a tensile strength of 400 psi and has a cross sectional
area of 23.4 sq. inches. Assuming it is 23&#8221; long and has an elongation
percentage of .0036%/120psi at roomtemperature, how long will the baby
be before it is&nbsp;dismembered?</p>
<p>A: about 26.45&nbsp;inches.</p>
<p>Q: A 12 year old blind orphan girl is shot from a cannon at the speed of
1200 fps at a solid brick wall. Calculate the force of impact given that
the brick wall is 3 feet away from the&nbsp;barrel.</p>
<p>A: If she weighs 50 lbs, and all of her sticks to the wall, 3.3 million&nbsp;Newtons.</p>
<p>Q: A large plane weighing 12.7 M tons carrying 12 tons of nuns and
orphans travelling at 724.46 kph and at an altitude of 40,000 meters
suffers explosive decompression above the center of a 30km diameter
population. Assuming that one passenger is sucked out every second, how
many passengers will land within the population&nbsp;center?</p>
<p>A: about (give or take a torso or leg)&nbsp;12.</p>
<p>Q: A 1000 lb car is moving at 130 mph and two poodles whose combined
weight is 82 lbs are thrown out the back at 3 mph. Calculate the
velocity of the&nbsp;car.</p>
<p>A: 140.91 happy&nbsp;mph.</p>
<h2>anarchism</h2>
<p>Q: Why do they bury cops six feet&nbsp;under?</p>
<p>A: Because deep down they&#8217;re really&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>Q: What&#8217;s the difference between a porcupine and a cop&nbsp;car?</p>
<p>A: The porcupine has its pricks on the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Q: How do you make a cop sound like a&nbsp;dog?</p>
<p>A: Pour gas and light a match.&nbsp;<span class="caps">WOOF</span>.</p>
<p>Q: How do you make a cop&nbsp;cry?</p>
<p>A: Throw back the teargas&nbsp;canister.</p>
<p>Q: What&#8217;s the worst thing about a squad car with two cops in it driving
off a&nbsp;cliff?</p>
<p>A: Squad cars seat at least&nbsp;four.</p>
<p>Q: How many insurrectionist anarchists does it take to change a&nbsp;lightbulb?</p>
<p>A: The lightbulb cannot be changed, it must be&nbsp;smashed!</p>
<p>Q: How many crust punks does it take to change a&nbsp;lightbulb?</p>
<p>A: There&#8217;s change in a&nbsp;lightbulb?</p>
<p>Q: How many tree-sitters does it take to screw in a&nbsp;lightbulb?</p>
<p>A: Tree-sitters don&#8217;t screw in lightbulbs, silly; they screw in&nbsp;trees.</p>
<p>Q: How many individualist anarchists does it take to change a&nbsp;lightbulb?</p>
<p>A:&nbsp;One.</p>
<p>Q: How many hipsters does it take to screw in a&nbsp;lightbulb?</p>
<p>A: Ah, it&#8217;s a really obscure number, man&#8230;you wouldn&#8217;t&nbsp;know.</p>
<p>Q: How many vegans does it take to screw in a&nbsp;lightbulb?</p>
<p>A: I don&#8217;t know, but where do you get your&nbsp;protein?</p>
<p>Q: Why did the primitivist move to&nbsp;Eugene?</p>
<p>A: He heard there was no work&nbsp;there.</p>
