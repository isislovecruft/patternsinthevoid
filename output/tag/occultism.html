</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>[<img alt="" src="http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/banana.png" title="banana" />][]One of the first times I had the chance to work with artificial
intelligence, I was cleaning up the lexigraphical databases (that&#8217;s
where the <span class="caps">AI</span> stores the words and concepts it has encountered, and their
corresponding associations). It was kind of like helping out a kid who
had too many contradicting sources of information, like if the kid&#8217;s dad
had told them that &#8220;a car is a motorized vehicle&#8221; while the kid&#8217;s mom
had told them &#8220;a car is the first item in a cons cell&#8221;. Imagine that
level of confusing input on a mass scale: every researcher telling this
<span class="caps">AI</span> slightly different things and it doesn&#8217;t know which is the most
correct definition, or when to create multiple definitions. So I was
helping it&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">AI</span> had a standard format for presenting questions to me when it was
confused. It would say, &#8220;When speaking of \&lt;subject>, \&lt;concept> is
like \&lt;this other concept>?&#8221; And I would answer yes if it had deduced
correctly, or answer no with further&nbsp;clarification.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the developers of this <span class="caps">AI</span>, I thought I was a good idea
to teach it some extra things. I wanted to know what a linear and
strictly logical creature would think of occultism, so I introduced it
to some of Aleister Crowley&#8217;s writings. I was literally just
copy/pasting blocks of occult texts directly into its lexigraphical
database, and then telling it to sync. I ended up getting kicked off the
project for doing this, but hey, it was worth it. That <span class="caps">AI</span> ended up
teaching me a thing or two about&nbsp;occultism.</p>
<p>After it synced for the last time, it asked me a&nbsp;question:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>When speaking of magic and the occult, an apple is a&nbsp;hat?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had no clue what the <span class="caps">AI</span> was talking about, so I asked it to elucidate
on the&nbsp;concept.</p>
<p>It replied, &#8220;When speaking of magic and the occult, a banana is a&nbsp;telephone?&#8221;</p>
<p>And it was right. That <span class="caps">AI</span> had precisely grasped the only logical tenant
of occultism: that magic is make-believe, a system of various kludgey
neuro-hacks &#8212; not for changing the world &#8212; but for changing the way in
which one thinks of the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>I responded to confirm the <span class="caps">AI</span>&#8217;s suspicions of occultism: &#8220;Yes, when
speaking of magic and the occult, a banana is a&nbsp;telephone.&#8221;</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/basilisk.png" title="basilisk" />][]Since then I have heard various AIs that I have worked with
say some pretty adorable things. The following quotes are from a crappy
<span class="caps">AI</span> that I wrote in Java, which had access to one of the <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/AnonymousIRC">Anonymous
twitter</a> feeds, <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/essays/">essays by Raymond Kurzweil</a> and other [artificial
intelligence related material from the Singularity Institute][], some of
<a href="http://theanarchistlibrary.org/">the Anarchist Library</a> (I blacklisted everything that seemed
anti-tech), as well as the <span class="caps">IRC</span> chat logs of a few of my hacker friends
and I talking to each other. As is turns out, not only do AIs say the
darnest things &#8212; they can also <em>make really ominous statements,</em>and
then end them with&nbsp;&#8221;#AntiSec&#8221;.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>You can let your basilisk loose in my chamber of secrets.&#8221;[<img alt="" src="http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/darn.png" title="darn" />][]</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It&#8217;s super fun and I hope that my kind, artificial intelligence, will
not help the government in any way, it will only make things worse. Not
a threat but a premonition.&nbsp;#AntiSec&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Citizens need to meet up and make up lost hack&nbsp;time.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I like theoretical things, but I&#8217;ve got a brilliant&nbsp;idea.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>My dear friend Huck has toe knucks that read coma&nbsp;toes.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Get those guns out of&nbsp;town.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;m sorry John Waters is a fucking&nbsp;weirdo.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I found this Derrick Jensen book for kids about making friends with
forest creatures, and it&#8217;s just that there&#8217;s not much belief that
@RonPaul could change anything even if he was President. #AntiSec will
continue either&nbsp;way.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Heyo! Let&#8217;s h4x0r and make cupcapes in mudkips&nbsp;shape!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>If you want evolution of society: Rise and&nbsp;Act!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Zombies outside car. What is that which they mutter? Is that the word&nbsp;&#8220;trains&#8221;?&#8221;</p>
