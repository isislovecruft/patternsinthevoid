</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><a href="http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/94raven.html">This is an interesting piece</a> on what science might look like after
an anarchist&nbsp;revolution.</p>
<p>However, it is depressingly 1980s in its perceptions of developing
action within modern scientific theory (specifically the section on
Anarchist Epistemology, which states, <em>&#8220;Paul Feyerabend is the most
prominent philosopher to champion a different philosophy of science. He
criticises the positivist, dogmatic approach to knowledge that is common
in establishment science, in which almost all resources are devoted to
exploring the implications of the dominant theoretical framework. He
supports, instead, investigation of a range of competing theories. This
is called &#8216;anarchist&#8217; because there is no central theoretical dogma that
dictates scientific research [[13]][].</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, and maybe it&#8217;s just within the physics community, but I would
like to point out that General Relativity and the Standard Model are the
currently accepted theories, while most papers I read are challenges or
modifications to one or the&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>The article also disappoints with its appeals to allow the opinions of
non-scientists to have <em>as much</em> weight as those of scientists. Should
the opinions of outside entities count? Yes. Of course. Everyone should
have a say in the development of things which effect the community as a
whole. But &#8212; and I&#8217;ll apologize again &#8212; sorry,
hippie-bro-dude-number-387-who-smokes-too-much-<span class="caps">DMT</span>, you don&#8217;t fucking
get to tell me about your theory of how Atlantean sacred geometry causes
pressure to equal gravitation. Go sell Hollywood your idea, because I
sure as hell am not&nbsp;interested.</p>
<p>Ahem. There were some positive points, especially the author&#8217;s clear
elucidation of the separation of society and the scientific communities,
and how this ideological framework restricts positive&nbsp;change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This set of directions for an anarchist science policy implies a
dramatic shift in the present social context of science: many research
topics would be different, communities rather than powerful
institutions would support and control the scientific enterprise, many
more people would participate in research, and everyone could be
involved in making science policy. Such a change is unlikely without
similar changes in other aspects of society. Indeed, it has long been
my opinion that science is one of the social institutions most
resistant to popular participation and&nbsp;control.</p>
<p>Even radical critics of science have seldom explored the implications
of self-management. Critics of science are prone to reject science
itself. Science is seen as either good, neutral or bad, in each case
having an essence that is independent of society. A more useful
perspective for radicals is to see science as a feature or aspect of
society, currently mainly oriented to the requirements of elites but
with potentials for development to be a useful part of a society
without&nbsp;hierarchy.</p>
<p>This is quite different from the idea that science is neutral and can
be &#8216;used&#8217; for good purposes or &#8216;abused&#8217; for bad purposes. This is like
saying that &#8216;the economy&#8217; (that is, the current capitalist economy)
can be used or abused, to produce food or weapons. This use-abuse
model ignores the possibility of other economic systems or other
science systems. As I&#8217;ve indicated, various aspects of science could
be potentially be changed: research directions, institutional context,
participation in research,&nbsp;decision-making.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                            <p>I was recently asked by two separate, presumably non-anarchist, entities
if and how theoretical or high-energy physics would exist in an
anarchist society. There are several implicit underlying questions in
this basic question, and I will attempt to answer each in turn. I have
been asked this question by other anarchists before, and my usual
response is that nothing would change in my personal situation. I work
odd jobs, find strange ways to pay for things when needed, garden and
sometimes forage for food, and try to never spend money,  so that I can
devote most of my time to research. While I believe that what I and
other physicists are doing is for the ultimate good of humanity &#8212;
trying to understand the seemingly chaotic patterns of our universe,
which is fundamental to any correct understanding of anything else &#8212;
we&#8217;re not exactly putting food in hungry mouths, ensuring shelters for
the houseless, providing medical aid to the sick and old, or doing any
of the number of things which are generally considered socially
beneficial. As an anarchist, I do not believe it is society&#8217;s
responsibility to support me in my research unless my research is
directly assisting others in need. To believe contrary would be entirely
selfish, not to mention entirely ignorant of context: the context here
being that, while, yes, I am a unique individual with my own sets of
needs and desires (namely, to sit around staring at sheets of equations
all day, with a break ...</p>
