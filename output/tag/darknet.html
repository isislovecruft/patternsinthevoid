</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Sunday 7th August, 2011, Defcon 19, Las&nbsp;Vegas</p>
<h2>Whitfield Diffie <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Moxie&nbsp;Marlinspike</h2>
<p>It was nice to hear my friend Moxie talk with another admirable
cryptographer, Whitfield Diffie, <em>a la</em> <a href="https://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2248">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>.
I hope, if Mr. Diffie should happen to read this, that he shall excuse
my link to <span class="caps">RSA</span> laboratories. However, it was regrettable to have so many
time burglars during the Q&amp;A pretending to ask questions while actually
egotistically talking about obscure research they once did, or posing
artificial problems for <a href="http://convergence.io">Moxie&#8217;s Covergence project</a> (a <span class="caps">P2P</span>
replacement for the current Certificate Authority structure, the former
of which bears similarities to the <span class="caps">PGP</span>/<span class="caps">GPG</span> web-of-trust structure).
Commenting on his project, at one point, Moxie said, &#8220;I believe that
Certificate Authorities and politicians are incredibly similar. That is,
I believe that trust in either should expire and and be replaced on a
second-to-second basis.&#8221; Oh, Moxie. I think you just made every other
crypto-anarchist on the planet fall in love with you.&nbsp;\&lt;(A)3</p>
<h2>Cipherspaces <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Darknets</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.irongeek.com/">Adrian &#8220;Irongeek&#8221; Crenshaw</a>&#8216;s talk, &#8220;Cipherspaces/Darknets: An
Overview of Attack Strategies&#8221;, was incredibly basic. I was disappointed
to waste my hour listening to essentially the exact same talk I gave at
Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, on anonymity networks.
Snore. I did learn one new thing, namely that Firefox can be configured
to mitigate <span class="caps">DNS</span> leakage while using Tor by going into the about:config
and setting network.proxy.socks_remote_dns to true. But that&#8217;s really
only useful if you&#8217;re using <em>only</em> Tor for anonymity &#8212; if you use a
well-configured <span class="caps">VPN</span> before connecting to Tor your <span class="caps">DNS</span> should already be
geolocationally&nbsp;randomized.</p>
<h2>Cryptographic&nbsp;Oracles</h2>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dan_crowley">Daniel Crowley</a> gave a talking <a href="https://good.net/dl/k4r3lj/DEFCON19/DEFCON-19-Crowley-Cryptographic-Oracles.pdf">on defeating various cryptographic
schemes using oracles</a>. Crowley, who is adorable and has an excellent
surname, gave a brief overview of cryptographic terms and ideas, and
then delved into encryption and decryption oracles. An oracle is
essentially any data which is leaked from a cryptographic scheme. So,
for example, if I send multiple queries to a database which uses
encryption, I can get a good idea of how that encryption is occurring
based on the server&#8217;s responses to manipulated queries such as &#8220;aaaa&#8221;
&#8220;aaaabbbbaaaabbbb&#8221; &#8220;ababab&#8221; etc. At one point during Crowley&#8217;s demo,
which sadly didn&#8217;t work as expected, Crowley was using the encrypted
data from a cookie to make <span class="caps">SQL</span> injections on a website&#8217;s encrypted
database. The attack was supposed to result in a page which read &#8220;I have
a crush on Moxie Marlinspike&#8230;shh!&#8221; but, again, it didn&#8217;t work during
the live demo. As I said earlier, Moxie, every crypto-anarchist and
cipherpunk on the planet is in love with&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>The next talk was on the use of PLCs in the prison system. I&#8217;m going to
devote an entire post to discussing this, later, when I&#8217;m already in a
bad mood, because that talk made me sick to my stomach with some of the
things I realized. And the presenters&#8217; compliance with government
agencies and sociopathic lust to put other human&#8217;s in cages was
absolutely disgusting. Fuck&nbsp;them.</p>    </article>

the 29th of May at the Black Rose Infoshop. Here&#8217;s the&nbsp;flyer!</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/hackzor-page1.png" title="advdigsecworkshopflyer" />][]</p>
<p>![][1]</p>
<p>The last workshop we did covered the basics: encrypting emails and chat,
and using Tor. This workshop will cover a teensy bit more advanced
topics, and it&#8217;s leading up to the next one which will be on DDoSing
techniques and tools and online activism. If you missed the first
workshop, but feel reasonably comfortable with the basics, or you just
want to hang around and listen, you should stop by. Everyone&#8217;s more than
welcome to attend &#8212; our aim is to help our fellow activists regardless
of where they&#8217;re at. Come on by, and bring your questions and&nbsp;computers!</p>

Connections: The Dark Freenet][] (click for&nbsp;.pdf)</p>
<p>I learned that data encryption within a Freenet (not necessarily dark)
is often restricted to two types: CHKs and SSKs (6). As a basic measure
against profiling and traffic analysis, documents are relegated to set
sizes &#8212; 32kb for CHKs (Content Hash Key, a type of symmetric
cryptographic key generation in which the data includes the means of
generating the key) and 1kb for SSKs (Signed Subspace Key, i.e. ain
information publisher has an asymmetric key-pair used to sign documents
within a free(/dark)net subspace. Any larger documents are split up into
smaller ones to maintain this size imperative. Also, as anyone who has
used any type of <span class="caps">P2P</span> net has experienced, search functions within the
network are limited, but I just learned the reason why: directories
aren&#8217;t plaintext, but are (usually) <span class="caps">MD5</span> hashes of locations. So, unless
you know the precise location of the document or information you&#8217;re
trying to access, and thus can generate the matching <span class="caps">MD5</span> hash, you can&#8217;t
even discover that the directory is there. Kind of like how you can&#8217;t
access an .onion site unless you already know the address. This was
making my brain itch a little bit, but I&#8217;m good&nbsp;now.</p>
