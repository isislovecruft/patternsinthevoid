<p>Let&#8217;s play a game. This game, called “<a href="http://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2008/03/18/game-theory-tuesdays-winning-a-%E2%80%9Cbeauty-contest%E2%80%9D-or-how-my-professor-gambled-250-teaching-a-lesson/">Guess Two Thirds of the
Average</a>” is usually one of the first games that students of game
theory are exposed to. The game works like this: There is a room full of
people, and each is asked to choose a number between zero and one
hundred. The winner is the person who chooses the number which is two
thirds of the average of everyone else&#8217;s numbers combined. So, if
everyone else picks one hundred, and you chose sixty-six, you would&nbsp;win.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://museumofmoney.org/exhibitions/games/guessnumber2.htm">interactive flash applet of the game</a>, which you can play
with other people online to get an idea of how this game plays out in
the general population. You might want to check that out before I go any
farther in explaining the theory of how the game should be played
through a purely rational or superrational&nbsp;strategy.</p>
<p>So, obviously, all numbers sixty-seven and above are automatically ruled
out as possible solutions. However, what if <em>the other players</em> are
clever enough to also realize this? Well, that&#8217;s simple then: you can
assume that no one else will choose anything over sixty-six, and
therefore the maximum number you should pick is two thirds of that, so
forty-four. But wait! Just <em>how clever</em> are these other players? Have
they realized this as well? Because if they have, you shouldn&#8217;t guess
above twenty-nine. Oh jeepers, these <em>other players</em> could be really
smart, like <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~hauert/research/gamelab/twothirds.html">math nerds</a> or something. They could be doing all the
same meta-processing as you&#8217;re doing. Better not guess above&nbsp;nineteen&#8230;</p>
<p>This would be a purely rational strategy, and taken to its logical
conclusion, it clearly rules out all numbers except zero. However, if
you played around with the applet above, you already know that the
winning number for the game played within a sector of the general
population (read: not math nerds) is much higher – in some cases as high
as twenty-four (I think that one was conducted at a liberal arts
college&#8230;). So, if we look at each level of processing in the purely
rational strategy, we can label them as&nbsp;follows.</p>
<p>0º : 66.67 (It&#8217;s the zeroth-degree of processing because&#8230;well, you&#8217;d
literally have to have rocks in your head to not get at least that&nbsp;level.)</p>
<p>1º :&nbsp;44.45</p>
<p>2º :&nbsp;29.63</p>
<p>3º :&nbsp;19.75</p>
<p>4º :&nbsp;13.17</p>
<p>5º :&nbsp;8.78</p>
<p>6º :&nbsp;5.85</p>
<p>7º :&nbsp;3.90</p>
<p>8º :&nbsp;2.60</p>
<p>9º :&nbsp;1.73</p>
<p>10º:&nbsp;1.16</p>
<p>11º:&nbsp;0.77</p>
<p>12º:&nbsp;0.51</p>
<p>13º:&nbsp;0.34</p>
<p>Therefore, it is statistically shown that the general human population
is incapable of rational thought for more than three successive
iterations. My first thought at this was: “Grumble, grumble&#8230;and I
thought humans could be intelligent enough to forego government.” It&#8217;s
like, even more demoralizing than anarchist&nbsp;in-fighting.</p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s good news. (And, there is also <a href="http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Possibility-of-Cooperation-Michael-Taylor.zip"><em>The Possibility of
Cooperation</em> (.pdf.zip)</a>, an anarchist game theory textbook by Michael
Taylor.) You see, I realized, and plenty of other people have realized,
including the United States government, that the general population&#8217;s
lack of rationality can be exploited. Now, I equivocate here (“Faith,
here&#8217;s an equivocator, that could / swear in both the scales against
either scale, who com- / mitted treason enough for God&#8217;s sake, yet could
/ not equivocate to heaven. O, come in, equivocator.” - Shakespeare,
Macbeth, 2.3.8-10); let me clarify. There are two uses which immediately
bear to mind concerning exploitation of irrationality: the first, for
purposes of subjugation and control, and the second, for information&nbsp;analysis.</p>
<h2>Predicting The&nbsp;Game</h2>
<p>Earlier, in <a href="http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/2011/01/game-theory-anarchism-why-snitches-are-snitches-and-why-anarchists-are-not-snitches/">my first Game Theory <span class="amp">&amp;</span> anarchism piece</a>, I mentioned
Douglas Hofstader&#8217;s concept of superrationality, that a player of games
takes into consideration a broader contextual analysis of both the game
and the other players&#8217; strategies in order to formulate their own
strategy. In light of the concept of superrationality, the general
population&#8217;s abrupt halt at meta-processing level three – instead of
being interpreted as qualitative proof of human stupidity – can rather
be viewed as proof of humans <em>assuming</em>human stupidity and altering
their actions based upon this judgment. To spell it out in plaintext in
case you didn&#8217;t catch that: humans will generally assume that other
humans are irrational, and so suspend their own rationality to act on a
common level. Thus, superrationality is a prediction of the level of
meta-processing power of&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Moving back to the information analysis bit, this prediction can become
a tool when applied on a mass scale. Take the stock market, for example.
Traders ultimately base their calculations not on how financially well
they believe Evil, Inc. is going to do, but on how financially well
<em>other traders</em> think Evil, Inc. is going to do. The stock market is not
strictly a financial market, but an information market detailing
predictions of human&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>Before I go into some really wonderful potentials for <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Prediction_markets">predictive
markets</a>, let me briefly outline some really terrible ones. As I said,
this is a tool; a pickaxe is neither intrinsically good nor bad. You can
mine coal with it, or kill Trotsky with it&#8230;okay, both of those might
be bad, but you get my&nbsp;point.</p>
<h2>Rigging The&nbsp;Game</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.palantirtech.com">Palantir Technologies</a> is a corporation based in the silicon valley
which offers extremely powerful informational analytics engines to
government and financial institutions. This technology is being used to
scour databases – everything from Twitter to employment records – to
ultimately determine who knows who, what everyone is doing, and what
groups contain which members. The user interface for their program is
highly impressive, featuring keyword searching and geographical
overlays. Put simply, this is very bad news for political and civil
rights activists. With this software, an intelligence agent can simply
type the keyword “anarchist” into the user interface, zoom in on any
given city, and be presented with a map of who is likely to be an
anarchist and the statistical probability of their being so, where they
are believed to live or work, and who they are likely involved with. Bad
news fucking bears. However, at the risk of sounding like a broken
record, this is a tool, and is not “bad” <em>per se</em>. This same software,
if obtained by activists, could be used to route out undercover agents
within the&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Palantir&#8217;s software is not, strictly speaking, an information market;
it&#8217;s only information analysis. However, another similar company,
<a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Futures</a>, is claiming that it can use, for all intents and
purposes, the same information databases and heuristic models to predict
the future. Why stop at knowing the identities of the black bloc
yesterday when you can know what their identities will be next week?
Perhaps it&#8217;s worth mentioning that <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/exclusive-google-cia/">their two largest investors are
Google and the <span class="caps">CIA</span></a>.</p>
<p>In 2003, <span class="caps">DARPA</span> publicly announced their own <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Policy_Analysis_Market">Policy Analysis Market</a>,
appropriately nicknamed the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/nps/pam/si_pam.htm">Terrorism Market</a>, in which traders&#8217; bets
would be used to predict the likelihood of various political actions in
the Middle East, such as the probability of the United States recalling
its troops from Saudi Arabia or Egyptian currency falling by 20% by the
end of the year. Controversially, and the subject of mass media outcry,
the original plan for the Policy Analysis Market also included
predictions for the probabilities, and dates of, assassinations of
public figures. Which is where we now get into the really wonderful uses
of this&nbsp;tool.</p>
<h2>Hacking The&nbsp;Game</h2>
<p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Jim_Bell">Jim Bell</a>, a crypto-anarchist and <span class="caps">MIT</span> graduate, wrote a famous essay
back in the day called <a href="http://jya.com/ap.htm">“Assassination Markets”</a>. I remember reading
it on my home-built <span class="caps">PC</span> in grade school and having my little mind blown
to smithereens. (Oh, the potentials! Oh, so dark! Oh, so radical!)
Anyway. In that essay, Bell outlines a system, using currently available
encryption and privacy methods (such as <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/"><span class="caps">PGP</span></a> generated asymmetric
keys, online anonymous currencies like <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">BitCoin</a>, and networks like
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.onion">Tor Hidden Services</a>), for people to place online, completely
anonymous, bets on the precise date and time of a government official&#8217;s
death. The person who guesses correctly collects all the money. This
ceases to be a pure prediction market, and crosses over into real life,
becoming an assassination market: the winner is (most likely, although
of course, not provably) the assassin, and everyone else who
purposefully bet wrongly is merely donating the in the amount that they
would like to see said official dead. Of course, none of this is
provable in any way, and for details of how the system would be set up
you should read the original paper. Even the people running the server
which hosts the assassination market would be incapable of giving out
any data on the assassin if requested to or if&nbsp;subpoenaed.</p>
<p>Jim Bell is now currently in prison. The original offense was
“harassment of a federal agent”. However, if you take a closer look at
the story, Bell claimed that federal agents were stalking him, and they
in turn claimed that he was stalking them and thereby charged him with
harassment. He got out in 2009, but was taken in again in 2010 for
violation of parole. I&#8217;m sure his parole conditions read something like
“Thou shalt not so much as look at a computer&#8230;” Bastards. Jim Bell did
other awesome things though, before they entrapped him. Somewhere in the
&#8216;90s, in Portland, Oregon, he was part of the Multnomah County Common
Law Court, which had no judicial authority according to federal laws,
and which put government officials on trial <em>in absentia</em> and relegated
judgments and sentences against them&nbsp;accordingly.</p>
<p>Now for the doublepluscool part, and the reason why I&#8217;ve been setting
all this up. Though I&#8217;m sure I lost half the anarchist milieu at the
mention of mathematics, and half the math geeks at the mention of
crypto-anarchism, that still leaves an estimated two people reading
this. So it might be intellectual masturbation, but I&#8217;d like to take a
look into applications of superrationality to assassination markets as
part of a broader study of how such a market might function, what
impediments may present themselves, and if such a market can be
considered moral in the first&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Before I go any further in my explorations of such a dangerous idea, I
would like to plainly state that my interest is purely academic, and
give the following reasons. My overall goal in life can be summarized
as: I would like to live to see the creation of a technologically
advanced anarchist society. While with a cursory glance this may appear
as motivation to develop an assassination market, it also presents
several obstacles. I&#8217;ll go through the obstacles in order of words in
the original statement. First, <em>I would like to live</em>. I believe if an
assassination market were to be effectuated, political leaders could
retaliate by pooling bets against those involved in sustaining the
existence of that market. I&#8217;m not suicidal. Second, <em>technological
advancement</em> requires broader sociocultural backing and support for its
development, and using computer technology for such morally ambiguous
ends could result in a shift towards greater fear of technological
advancement. Technology should be ultimately used for the good of all
people, with respect for the environment we share. Lastly, my
interpretation of the phrase <em>anarchist society</em> is a world in which
there are no leaders, where individuals&#8217; capacities for informed agency
for action is maximized as a whole. Obviously, murder reduces one&#8217;s
agency to zero. Note that I said “as a whole”: murder can be acceptable,
provided that the person who is murdered was taking extreme actions to
limit the degrees of freedom of others. In this way, freedom as a whole
is maximized. However, an assassination market would be begging to be
abused in any number of ways, and I cannot foresee that agency and
freedom would always be maximized. Thus, the following thought
experiments are purely academic, as I&#8217;m not assured of the morality of
actualizing&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>First, I would like to point out that there is an <a href="http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion">&#8220;assassination
market&#8221; on Tor already</a>. (Note: you must be connected to the Tor
network to view .onion sites. If you&#8217;re unsure about your Tor
configuration, don&#8217;t know what Tor is, or otherwise don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;re doing, <em>please don&#8217;t click that link</em>.) The problem with it is
that a contractor posts a mark, or an individual they wish doom and
gloom upon, and sets a price on their head. Then the &#8220;bidders&#8221;
anonymously (through TorPM) contact the contractor with a deathday
prediction, and if they are correct the contractor pays them the
previously set amount. From a user named &#8220;admin&#8221;, it is explained&nbsp;that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Basically, you bet (using TorBank) on the day of a particular
individual&#8217;s death. Once TorBank gets up, the forum will become active
for assassination&nbsp;bets.</p>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<p>​1. The contractor creates a thread with the details about the target,
payment amount, and contact information&nbsp;(TorPM).</p>
<p>​2. The takers on the assassination bet will contact the contractor
through TorPM and will provide their TorBank information along with
the date that they predict the target will die&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>​3. Once the target dies, the contractor looks through their TorPM
offers and identifies the contact who correctly predicted the death
date. The contact then gets paid through&nbsp;TorBank.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not an assassination market. It&#8217;s not a even a market. It&#8217;s a
centralized and fatally untrustworthy system for hiring cold-blooded
killers. There are no true bets, there&#8217;s just a price. And, furthermore,
the contractor isn&#8217;t bound in any way to uphold the agreement &#8212; they
could just as well run with the money after the job is done. Likewise,
the killer could merely kidnap the victim, bake cookies and have a tea
party in fancy dresses with them, claim they&#8217;re dead and then split the
money with&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>That &#8220;assassination market&#8221; would be modeled as a non-iterative
Prisoner&#8217;s&nbsp;Dilemma:</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/game-a-market.png" title="Game Theory Analysis of Tor &quot;Assassination Market&quot;" />][]Which has the Nash equilibrium of mutual defection (the
contractor runs with the money, and the killer merely kidnaps), which is
Pareto sub-optimum. Same as the regular ol&#8217; Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma. The
greater problem in this scenario is that there is little or no
possibility for cooperation because it is not an iterated (i.e.
repeated) game. Because the users of this false &#8220;assassination market&#8221;
remain anonymous, as they should, there is the regrettable consequence
that there is no available mechanism for building reputation and trust.
Which is why, in Jim Bell&#8217;s original proposal, trust is centralized in
the server hosting the market &#8212; that way, if the server repeatedly
fails to deliver payments, trust is broken and no one will participate
in the&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>A potential problem in Bell&#8217;s scheme is the intrinsic inaccuracy to the
information on the number of betters that the Assassination market
provides. That is, there is the possibility of a single entity, rather
than placing one bet for \$100,000,000, placing one hundred million bets
for \$1, which would skew the information in the market. Basically,
which looks sketchier: a single billionaire willing to put down on
someone&#8217;s death, or a global community of people who all agree that
someone should&nbsp;die?</p>
<p>That problem arises from the very nature of anonymity: if you are
capable of being anonymous once, you&#8217;re capable of being anonymous on
infinite separate occasions. The only solution I can imagine would be to
build some type of hardware, a handset device or something,
manufacturing one for every single person on the planet. Each handset
would be a personalized betting machine, i.e. it would be possible to
tell that a certain machine is making multiple bets, but not which
machine, among all the others, it is. However, this would embroil a slew
of new problems for the networking involved and uncountable security
issues that I don&#8217;t even want to begin&nbsp;pondering.</p>
<p>David Lindorff, in <em>CounterPunch Newsletter</em>, brings up another possible
skew scenario for assassination&nbsp;markets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>So we&#8217;d have to worry about people manipulating the terrorism futures
market, I guess. And how would you do that? Bet on a dramatic but
highly unlikely assassination, maybe, like the president of the United
States perhaps, or the terror bombing of a high-profile target like
Disney Land or the Chunnel. And then go out and finance the hit by
some willing terror cell. Such market manipulation would give a whole
new meaning to that Wall Street term &#8216;making a&nbsp;killing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the problem with this critique is that Lindorff apparently can&#8217;t do
math. If a person were to bet such a large amount on an obscure event
(large enough that it would tip the market, meaning most of the money in
the market would be coming from that person), and then go out and pay
someone to cause the event, then they would simply get their money back,
plus a little extra from the market for having the correct prediction.
But <em>they lose all the money used to fund the event actually occurring</em>.
Why would someone bother to use a prediction market in this context,
when no money would be made by doing so? Wouldn&#8217;t it be simpler to just
fund the&nbsp;event?</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.anti-state.com/vroman/vroman9.html">a detailed and extensive response by
Robert Vroman</a> to <a href="http://www.anti-state.com/murphy/murphy17.html">two</a> <a href="http://www.anti-state.com/young/young2.html">objections</a> made against <a href="http://www.anti-state.com/vroman/vroman8.html">his original
essay on the Bell Assassination Politics</a>&nbsp;system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First Murphy doubts the feasibility of <span class="caps">AP</span> with the very legitimate
concern that if the system were truly an impenetrable secret to all
investigators, there is nothing stopping the <span class="caps">AP</span> operators from
pocketing all the donations, yet claiming winners had been paid,
resting on the impossibility of discovery, and the robbed winner’s
desire to remain anonymous (since he’s probably got blood on his
hands). A better scam might involve creating artificially high
bounties, and then only paying out what’s actually in the pot. Since
if there are multiple bets on the same day, the prize is split evenly
between them, the assassin will not know if he has been cheated or if
there are actually were enough other random guessers to dilute his
prize down to the share he actually gets. The administrators could
also skim off a healthy chunk too, and no one would be the wiser. This
would probably be the best way to for the admins to dishonestly game
the system, so that they enrich themselves; the assassins are
disappointed but not given proof of treachery; and the bounties are
higher than normal, thus enticing more gullible&nbsp;thugs.</p>
<p>So is this really a problem? Seems to me the system still works
exactly as planned whether the admins are honest or not. The only
problem is getting people to trust the system in the first place,
which I’ll cover in a&nbsp;minute.</p>
<p>If we assume that the admins’ purpose in creating <span class="caps">AP</span> is to make as fat
a profit as possible, then they will not want to blatantly rip off hit
men, for fear that word will inevitably get out among the criminal
population that <span class="caps">AP</span> isn’t on the level. However, even in an extreme
case where the admins do embezzle every penny, it doesn’t matter.
Since very few people involved with <span class="caps">AP</span> will be actually killing
anyone, only a tiny minority of users will feel they have been
cheated, while the greater number will be convinced they got their
money’s worth. Thus they will continue to use the system. Future
assassins not in communication with their gypped colleagues will also
be led to believe others have been paid. Thus everything still works,
money goes in, prizes are accumulated, and targets are&nbsp;eliminated.</p>
<p>If the admins really are capable of hiding all evidence and expertly
conning the system, then the system will indeed be conned, and so well
conned, that it will continue to run despite being conned over and
over. The only problem is if this possibility prevents people from
ever starting to bet and becoming convinced they are being dealt with&nbsp;fairly.</p>
<p>There are two answers to this: the <span class="caps">AP</span> business can slowly build trust
with less extreme versions of itself, and also the overlooked fact
that people have surprisingly high tolerance for potentially
fraudulent online&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>To establish itself as an authentic operation, <span class="caps">AP</span> might be introduced
not as a full fledged death machine but instead as a low key betting
pool system whereby users could put money on sporting events or guess
the day certain celebrities will get divorced, and other trivial
wagers. The selling point is the hardcore anonyminity feature for
users in harsher nanny states. In this relatively low risk phase,
winners could have the option of being publicly announced for ego’s
sake, and this would prove the system operated as intended. Then
gradually more and more sinister bets would be allowed until it
becomes completely un-moderated and <span class="caps">AP</span> is&nbsp;born.</p>
<p>Such a system would not be nipped in the bud, as Murphy predicts, as
there are countless underground betting organizations currently in
operation, and proto-<span class="caps">AP</span> would arguably be even more secure from law
enforcement, by benefit of its exclusive existence on the internet
with solid encryption and no face to face contact among users. Even at
the intermediate semi-morbid phases its possible proto-<span class="caps">AP</span> would not
garner significant government attention. Look at this
<a href="http://www.stiffs.com/">http://www.stiffs.com</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly harmless, but the fact it has garnered no legal complaints is
a good indicator that real-<span class="caps">AP</span> would be able to go on the offensive for
some time before the Feds figured out where the threat is coming&nbsp;from.</p>
<p>I also still think the best idea is to design an autonomous system
with no publicly identified administrators even in the proto phase,
whether this will become feasible with future developments in
cryptography remains to be&nbsp;seen.</p>
<p>Even if <span class="caps">AP</span> did not go to the trouble of gradually building a customer
base, does not necessarily mean it will fail. Examine the case of
online gambling. Here we have people putting there money on games
where the &#8220;house&#8221; can completely manipulate the odds in its own favor
simply by changing a few lines of code, and the user will never know
unless he takes detailed notes on winning percentages. They do not
even have a reputation at stake like a traditional Las Vegas casino,
which could do the same with its electronic slot machines. If a Vegas
outfit says its slots pay out 99% or something, people who have no
good reason to trust that, still play by the thousands. Many people
are unaware that the Nevada Gaming Commission even exists, and
virtually none have any idea how good a job they do at enforcing
gambling regulations. And inexplicably they play online versions of
these same dubious games too, where they have far less control, and
nowhere near the trust of a &#8220;reputable&#8221; brick and mortar casino.
Online gambling rakes in millions, despite obvious security holes and
opportunities for abuse. An indicator that even if <span class="caps">AP</span> is not fool
proof as far as protecting bettor’s money from the admins, people will
still donate and predict. Maybe they’re just stupid, and maybe the
online casinos are actually&nbsp;honest.</p>
<p>Murphy also points out that if politicians resort to holding Congress
inside a <span class="caps">NORAD</span> bunker, then any information about deaths inside the
mountain can be easily manipulated by the government, thus disrupting
the rewarding of correct guessers. I doubt this will be an effective
countermeasure against <span class="caps">AP</span>. If the outside world never knows that the
Feds are lying about death dates, then potential assassins would not
be aware their successful hits might be in vain. They would then still
have motivation to mount their attacks, and only afterwards realize
the government’s press corps has cheated them out of their prize.
However, the people donating money have still gotten what they want: a
dead politician, and thus will continue donating. Since the assassin
will presumably either be dead, captured or in hiding, he will not be
able to warn anyone that the government is using information warfare
against <span class="caps">AP</span>. Thus the system continues as&nbsp;planned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it becomes common knowledge that the government
is not a reliable source of information, then it will be up to the
assassin to make the real death date known. Perhaps acquiring a tissue
sample from the victim and anonymously forwarding to independent
media, or videotaping the kill shot with some kind of provable date
stamp. This means the assassin has to take extra risk in getting close
enough to the body to grab some proof, or accidentally providing
incriminating evidence on tape, and also risk further exposure in
contacting the media. If the <span class="caps">AP</span> server is run autonomously, it will
have to be programmed to take into account the relative
trustworthiness of misinforming government sources versus potentially
nutcase indy media, and then make a decision as to the actual date of
death. If the information is too ambiguous, then it might extend prize
percentages to predictions on neighboring days, based on the
probability of being correct. In light of this possibility the
assassin would be smart to take out high interest loans and dump his
entire net worth into bets on days all around the planned kill&nbsp;date.</p>
<p>In light of this development the assassin will have to take more risks
and thus insist on a higher prize before taking his chances. Thus this
government strategy will only serve to increase the equilibrium price
of assassinations, just like their moving into the bunker&nbsp;itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with applying a Bell curve distribution (different Bell!) to
the payoff percentages of the assassination market is insurance. In a
non-lethal prediction market, say for example a market to predict who
will win the next <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Presidential election, a form of economic
insurance would be the following strategy: A bettor believes that, if
Mr. Puppet is elected, the economy will fall. So this bettor places
their money on Mr. Puppet being elected, that way, if he is, and the
economy falls, the bettor is compensated financially by winning part of
the betting pool. In the same way, if a Bell curve is implemented to the
assassination market, more people who believe the economy will be worse
off without the assassinated leader will be driven to bet as a form of
insurance. Except, now that I think about it, this isn&#8217;t really a
problem, as it would only increase the effective potential of the
assassination&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>I believe I&#8217;ve completely diverted from Gametheoryland and inadvertently
strayed to close to the borders of Ancapland. If anyone has further
applications of game theory to assassination markets, or prediction
markets in general, please comment. Or, in anyone has objections or
correction, please comment as&nbsp;well.</p>
