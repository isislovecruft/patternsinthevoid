</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>In Berlin, on New Year&#8217;s Eve, I participated in a race through the
streets of Berlin, called Journey to the End of the Night &#8212; except this
one, being at the end of the year, is called <a href="http://totheendoftheyear.com/">Journey to the End of the
Year</a>. The rules: run through six checkpoints in order, complete a
challenge at each one, and don&#8217;t get caught by the chasers or lose your&nbsp;armband.</p>
<p>I formed a running team with <a href="http://hellais.wordpress.com/">an Italian hacker who works on Tor</a>, and
his friend from Greece who is also a hacker. They showed up thirty
minutes late (for which the organizers, my friends <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fin">from Vienna</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Rubin110">San Francisco</a>, postponed the race) with a backpack full of
explosives. Let me tell you: Berliners take their fireworks <em>very
seriously</em>, and firework safety inversely so. It&#8217;s not uncommon at all
for a complete stranger to throw the equivalent of a quarter stick of
dynamite <em>in your direction</em>. Also, I noticed that Berliners like to
surprise you by throwing bottles and&nbsp;chairs.</p>
<p>So, armed to the teeth with explosives, we set out running through the
streets with others chasing us. Because there was a joke rule that my
friend Redbeard&#8217;s beard was a safe zone, I ended up having to kidnap him
from a checkpoint by aiming explosives at the other participants in the
race, and a few of the organizers too. Redbeard is awesome. He&#8217;s a
professional kernel hacker with a red beard down to his waist, if the
later wasn&#8217;t obviously by the name. I also had to dodge the
aforementioned chairs, bottles, and fireworks with parkour while wearing
a tinfoil hat. And at the end of it all, I found myself at [C-Base, a
hackerspace built into the remains of a two-millenia-old alien spaceship
crash][], discussing <span class="caps">DIY</span> soldering iron buttprobes, theoretical physics,
and hackers on sailboats, while drinking Chink Chank Chunk (Club Mate
with sugar, lime,&nbsp;vodka).</p>
<p>Oh Berlin, how I want to live in&nbsp;you!</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                            <p>The global Occupy Movement in its current incarnation can be
characterised quite accurately in terms of a War of Attrition, to use
evolutionary game theoretic&nbsp;terms.</p>
<p>At the starting point of evolutionary game theory, the first game
analysed by Maynard Smiths was called Hawk and Dove. In this game, two
contestants vie over a sharable resource. The two correspondent
strategies are that of Hawk and Dove. To play the Hawk is to display
aggressive behaviours, then escalate the competition for the resource
until either the Hawk wins or else is injured. Dove&#8217;s strategy in the
game is to first make a show of aggression, but, when faced with
escalation to physical violence, will turn heel and run&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>Here is the payoff matrix for the Hawk / Dove&nbsp;game:</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/hawkdove.jpeg" title="hawkdove" />][]So, War of Attrition &#8212; cool name, right? War of Attrition is
identical to the Hawk and Dove scenario, albeit that the resource is
<em>deemed unsharable</em>. So in the above scenario where either two Hawks or
two Doves vie, the desired resource is divided in accordance with the
payoff matrix. But in War of Attrition, this sharing or splitting of
resources is no longer an option, and so the violently aggressive
behaviours associated with the Hawk / Dove game are no longer effective
strategies. Instead, in War of Attrition, two new strategies, known as
Bluffer and Bourgeois&nbsp;emerge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A safer strategy of display, bluffing and waiting to win, then becomes
viable – a Bluffer strategy. The game then becomes one of accumulating
costs, either ...</p></blockquote>

<p>Q: Why are quantum physicists so poor at&nbsp;sex?</p>
<p>A: Because when they find the position, they can&#8217;t find the momentum,
and when they have the momentum, they can&#8217;t find the&nbsp;position.</p>
<p>Heisenberg went for a drive and got stopped by a traffic cop. The cop
asked, &#8220;Do you know how fast you were going?&#8221; Heisenberg replied, &#8220;No,
but I know where I&nbsp;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: How many theoretical physicists specializing in general relativity
does it take to change a light&nbsp;bulb?</p>
<p>A: Two. One to hold the bulb and one to rotate the&nbsp;universe.</p>
<p>There is this farmer who is having problems with his chickens. All of
the sudden, they are all getting very sick and he doesn&#8217;t know what is
wrong with them. After trying all conventional means, he calls a
biologist, a chemist, and a physicist to see if they can figure out what
is wrong. So the biologist looks at the chickens, examines them a bit,
and says he has no clue what could be wrong with them. Then the chemist
takes some tests and makes some measurements, but he can&#8217;t come to any
conclusions either. So the physicist tries. He stands there and looks at
the chickens for a long time without touching them or anything. Then all
of the sudden he starts scribbling away in a notebook. Finally, after
several gruesome calculations, he exclaims, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got it! But it only
works for spherical chickens in a&nbsp;vacuum.&#8217;</p>
