        <p>In <a href="../category/anarchism.html">anarchism</a> </p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>The global Occupy Movement in its current incarnation can be
characterised quite accurately in terms of a War of Attrition, to use
evolutionary game theoretic&nbsp;terms.</p>
<p>At the starting point of evolutionary game theory, the first game
analysed by Maynard Smiths was called Hawk and Dove. In this game, two
contestants vie over a sharable resource. The two correspondent
strategies are that of Hawk and Dove. To play the Hawk is to display
aggressive behaviours, then escalate the competition for the resource
until either the Hawk wins or else is injured. Dove&#8217;s strategy in the
game is to first make a show of aggression, but, when faced with
escalation to physical violence, will turn heel and run&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>Here is the payoff matrix for the Hawk / Dove&nbsp;game:</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/hawkdove.jpeg" title="hawkdove" />][]So, War of Attrition &#8212; cool name, right? War of Attrition is
identical to the Hawk and Dove scenario, albeit that the resource is
<em>deemed unsharable</em>. So in the above scenario where either two Hawks or
two Doves vie, the desired resource is divided in accordance with the
payoff matrix. But in War of Attrition, this sharing or splitting of
resources is no longer an option, and so the violently aggressive
behaviours associated with the Hawk / Dove game are no longer effective
strategies. Instead, in War of Attrition, two new strategies, known as
Bluffer and Bourgeois&nbsp;emerge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A safer strategy of display, bluffing and waiting to win, then becomes
viable – a Bluffer strategy. The game then becomes one of accumulating
costs, either the costs of displaying or costs of prolonged unresolved
engagement. It’s effectively an auction; the winner is the contestant
who will swallow the greater cost while the loser gets, for all his
pains, the same cost as the winner but <span class="caps">NO</span> resource. The resulting
evolutionary game theory mathematics leads to an optimal strategy of
timed bluffing, where any player backs off with equal probability at
any time in the contest - unguessable by his opponent. This is exactly
what is observed in nature for contests in a number of species, for
example between male dung flies contesting for mating sites. The
timing of disengagement in these contests follows the exact
mathematical curve derived from the evolutionary theory&nbsp;mathematics.</p>
<p>There is a mutant strategy which can better that of Bluffer in the War
of Attrition Game. This is the Bourgeois strategy (Maynard Smith named
the strategy Bourgeois, because with his background of communism he
regarded it as “politically bourgeois” way to value ownership).
Bourgeois uses an asymmetry of some sort to break the deadlock. In
nature one such asymmetry is possession - which contestant has the
prior possession of the resource. The strategy is to play a Hawk if in
possession of the resource, but to display then retreat if not in&nbsp;possession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one takes a look at the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/rpindyck/www/Courses/GT_05a.pdf">Collusive and Nash Equilibriums for the War
of Attrition</a>, it is clear that costs are exorbitantly high to both
players involved. However, payoff in terms of resources in this game is
<em>always</em> maximized for the Collusive&nbsp;Equilibrium.</p>
<p>I realise that last paragraph might be gobbledegook to some. Basically,
what this means is that if both people stand around bluffing for a long
time, or, even worse, if one just sits on an unshared resource and the
other one randomly runs up and puts on a show of dissent or aggression,
nothing&#8217;s going to get done. There will be high costs to both parties in
the long run. It would be better for the two parties to collude and thus
share the &#8220;unsharable&#8221;&nbsp;resource.</p>
<p>As for the Occupy Movement, I think you understand where I&#8217;m going. We
have a class of bourgeois dining on balconies and drinking champagne,
while staring down at a bunch of rabble-rousing protesters with tents on
Wall St. We have one group who is sitting smugly on a pile of ill-used
resources, and another group who is quite literally putting on a show of
aggression for the former. Now, the occupation is non-violent, we all
know this. And thus, the former group knows that this show is a bluff.
Nothing will happen. They can sit there drinking their champagne all
day, and nothing is going to&nbsp;change.</p>
<h2>Hey, Occupiers! <em>Guess&nbsp;what?</em></h2>
<h2>Bluffing is not an effective&nbsp;strategy.</h2>

<p>Q: Why are quantum physicists so poor at&nbsp;sex?</p>

and when they have the momentum, they can&#8217;t find the&nbsp;position.</p>

<p>There is this farmer who is having problems with his chickens. All of
the sudden, they are all getting very sick and he doesn&#8217;t know what is
wrong with them. After trying all conventional means, he calls a
biologist, a chemist, and a physicist to see if they can figure out what
is wrong. So the biologist looks at the chickens, examines them a bit,
and says he has no clue what could be wrong with them. Then the chemist
takes some tests and makes some measurements, but he can&#8217;t come to any
conclusions either. So the physicist tries. He stands there and looks at
the chickens for a long time without touching them or anything. Then all
of the sudden he starts scribbling away in a notebook. Finally, after
several gruesome calculations, he exclaims, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got it! But it only
works for spherical chickens in a&nbsp;vacuum.&#8217;</p>

an anarchist&nbsp;revolution.</p>
<p>However, it is depressingly 1980s in its perceptions of developing
action within modern scientific theory (specifically the section on
Anarchist Epistemology, which states, <em>&#8220;Paul Feyerabend is the most
prominent philosopher to champion a different philosophy of science. He
criticises the positivist, dogmatic approach to knowledge that is common
in establishment science, in which almost all resources are devoted to
exploring the implications of the dominant theoretical framework. He
supports, instead, investigation of a range of competing theories. This
is called &#8216;anarchist&#8217; because there is no central theoretical dogma that
dictates scientific research [[13]][].</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, and maybe it&#8217;s just within the physics community, but I would
like to point out that General Relativity and the Standard Model are the
currently accepted theories, while most papers I read are challenges or
modifications to one or the&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>The article also disappoints with its appeals to allow the opinions of
non-scientists to have <em>as much</em> weight as those of scientists. Should
the opinions of outside entities count? Yes. Of course. Everyone should
have a say in the development of things which effect the community as a
whole. But &#8212; and I&#8217;ll apologize again &#8212; sorry,
hippie-bro-dude-number-387-who-smokes-too-much-<span class="caps">DMT</span>, you don&#8217;t fucking
get to tell me about your theory of how Atlantean sacred geometry causes
pressure to equal gravitation. Go sell Hollywood your idea, because I
