    mikeperry ) yeah, the monthly tagging is useful for preventing yourself from being distracted by noise
    mikeperry ) it helps with the "omgwtfbbq! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO??" feeling
    mikeperry ) cause you just check the tag and chillax and tune out the noise
    mikeperry ) though this botnet and proposal writing has made that hard

    <nickm> (We do not want to ship a patched openssl if we can possibly avoid it.)
    <weasel> what could possibly go wrong with that?
    <nickm> weasel: you know. random stuff.

    <ioerror> i mean, did you see that CIA letter?
    <ioerror> they seriously cited the national security act
    <mikeperry> for control, we should perhaps FOIA the CIA data on some soccer mom
    <mikeperry> that might be a form letter.. I wouldn't expect intelligence agencies 
                to differ in their response if they had a file on you or not
    <ioerror> mikeperry: i already did so

              the ass.

    <isis>    The Adventures of SUPERHELIX #4: The wonders of drugs!
    <isis>    In this episode, our hero, SUPERHELIX, fights the nasty BERLIN DEATH FLU with the help of her sidekicks MODERN MEDICINE and CASHEWS
    <helix>   isis: haha I am fighting my broken tailbone ;)
    <helix>   isis: to contribute further to your superhelix mythology, the cortisone shot I got is one I have to give to myself
    <isis>    STRIKEOUT "BERLIN DEATH FLU" and ADD MORE GIANT NEEDLES
    <isis>    SUPERHELIX's ally, MODERN MEDICINE, a.k.a. DRUGS huddles with the SUPERHELIX in her sekrit base
    <isis>    artist conceptions of MODERN MEDICINE:

    <helix>   isis: I got the prescriptions from a fellow ninja, aka a bjj black belt who is also a surgeon
    <isis>    when enters a MAD SURGEON, who kicks people in half and then puts them back together
    <isis>    humpty dumpty style
    <isis>    it's like gangnam style, but more badass
    <isis>    SUPERHELIX senses through vibrations on the floor with her broken tailbone, that someone ninja-esque approaches
    <helix>   some people get arthritis when they break bones. I get butt echolocation.
    <elly>    butt echolocation.
    <isis>    it's a real superpower.
    <Yawning> hey it's an improvement over being aquaman
    <helix>   isis: I'm going to use it as the explanation for my constant need to dance
    <isis>    SUPERHELIX already kicked aquaman in half in episode #2, but it wasn't even worth noting, really
    <isis>    the MAD SURGEON tries, like some Ã¼bersketchoid, to sneak up on SUPERHELIX, but her superpower of BUTT ECHOLOCATION thwarts his maniacal plan
    <isis>    rising to her feet, SUPERHELIX sends an uppercut straight to the MAD SURGEON's big fat honking nose
    <isis>    KAAAAABLONK!!
