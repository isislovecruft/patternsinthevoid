    <ioerror> i mean, did you see that CIA letter?
    <ioerror> they seriously cited the national security act
    <mikeperry> for control, we should perhaps FOIA the CIA data on some soccer mom
    <mikeperry> that might be a form letter.. I wouldn't expect intelligence agencies 
                to differ in their response if they had a file on you or not
    <ioerror> mikeperry: i already did so
