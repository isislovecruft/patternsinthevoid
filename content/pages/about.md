My name is Isis Agora Lovecruft.  I do lots of things and wander the
planet.

I double majored in Theoretical Physics, and English Literature, the
latter with a
specialisation in Feminist Critical Theory. I used to say that, some day, when I'm bored with my
current work and adventures, I would continue my formal education to obtain a
doctorate in theoretical physics and contribute towards current research on
string cosmology and unified field theories.  The trouble with that
route, as I have come to believe, is that, were I to make some
discovery, it would be roughly thirty years before experimental
verification, and then another ten or so before application in either some
weapons system to make the powerful more powerful or in a more
efficient energy system to make the rich more rich.  Instead, I'll be doing a
Ph.D. in Cryptology, likely studying post-quantum cryptography.  At
least it'll be easier to put more accurate bounds on the probability
that my research goes towards evening the playing field.

I am an anarchist! And when I say that, I do not simply mean that I would like
to see all States destroyed, social hierarchies crumble, and state capitalism
perish. I mean that *I believe inequalities in power dynamics pose a hindrance
to the progression of human thought and scientific understanding*, that the
overall degrees of freedom for collected conscious agents should be maximised,
and that all forms of government are intrinsically immoral due to their
disregard of individual consent. I don't believe in control even down to the
microcosmic, interpersonal level. Expressed more colloquially: "*fuck you,
you're not my dad! make total destroy! kill it with fire.*"

I write. I've been known to grace the interwebz (and occasionally print
publications) with my science fiction, memoirs and other tall tales of my
exploits and adventures, and erotica. Lately, I haven't had much time to write
stories readable by mere humans -- instead, I've been working on fairy tales
for little robots, in the hope that when they grow up, they'll be joining us
in *the revolution*...or, at the very least, that they'll enable their human comrades
with means for free communication, privacy, anonymity, and all the digital
tricks and tools they'll need while making the world a bit saner.

I am also a musician. I have been classically trained at piano, and have
played for twenty years. I also play accordion, ten or so other instruments,
and lately I've been using tape loops to make more experimental music.  I'm
also working on a bytebeat album in Python,

### Contact

Please feel free to contact me with questions, bug reports, and proposals, or
for heated debates on any number of topics, potential friendship, and
collaboration! Though, please keep in mind that I'm doing *all of the things*,
so, if you're dangling from a burning rope over a shark tank, then I *might*
not be the best person to call.

A signed, timestamped copy of my various public keys can be found

file will include signed notices of any key updates I decide to make.
