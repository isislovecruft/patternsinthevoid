[This][] is kind of cute.

My personal interpretation of [Schrödinger's equations][] would
traditionally be to deny the actuality of wave function collapse, which
is part of the [Many-Worlds Interpretation][] of quantum mechanics, but
I haven't looked into this or really considered it since I was fourteen
(*thousand*) years old. I thought it was awesome at the time because
philosophically it meant that there exists a universe in which all
societies operate anarchistically, and if I just invented a proper time
machine I could chrono-emigrate there. I figured building a time machine
*had* to be simpler than fixing all the problems we have here and now.

EDIT: [This][1] is interesting too. It explains why coordinate
transformations in Schrödinger groups are dissimilar to those of
Galilean or Poincaré groups, because phase shifts under Lorentz boosts
are variant and dependent upon the mass(es) of the particle(s). Thus, in
order for the boosts to become covariant, proper time and relativity of
simultaneity need to be taken into account and prove central to even
non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
