I'm sorry I haven't written anything lately. For those of you who have
been worrying about me, I'm not dead, and, for reasons which I'll soon
explain, it's actually a bit ironic that everyone's worried of that.

So, I starting working for the [Tor Project][]. If all goes well with
funding, I'll be working with [Ioerror][]on reverse engineering a few
other "anonymity" tools, hacking on [Ooni-probe][] (a set of tools for
detecting different types of censorship around the world) with my
Italian friend [Hellais][], and probably continuing to do itty-bitty
things to help Nick and George with [Obfsproxy][].

I've also been scrambling to finish the [Dead Man's Switch][] for
Android, which I'm writing for [March Hare Communications Collective][].
When I finish that, please, everyone, stop pestering me if I'm dead.
*You [will][] know when I am dead.*

And...I've been really struggling with the neurological disorder I was
diagnosed with. I feel overwhelmed, especially when I have to be around
people, which has been nearly constantly for the past three months or
so. I want to write an AI that deals with all of the people for me.
Maybe I should write an AI that in turn writes all of the blog posts for
me. Actually...this is a great idea. "My" next post is going to be
awesome.
