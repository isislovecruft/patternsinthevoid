I recently discovered a young branch of theoretical physics: unparticle
physics.

Brief and simple explanation of the theory of unparticles from the
Wikipedia entry:

> All [particles][] exist in states that may be characterized by a
> certain [energy][], [momentum][] and [mass][]. In most of the
> [Standard Model][] of particle physics, particles of the same type
> cannot exist in another state with all these properties scaled up or
> down by a common factor â€“ [electrons][], for example, always have the
> same mass regardless of their energy or momentum. But this is not
> always the case: massless particles, such as [photons][], can exist
> with their properties scaled equally. This immunity to scaling is
> called "scale invariance".
>
> The idea of unparticles comes from conjecturing that there may be
> "stuff" that does not necessarily have zero mass but is still
> scale-invariant, with the same physics regardless of a change of
> length (or equivalently energy). This stuff is unlike particles, and
> described as unparticle.
>
> Such unparticle stuff has not been observed, which suggests that if it
> exists, it must couple with normal matter weakly at observable
> energies.

I've been reading up on this theory and wanted to post some academic
papers so that others may do the same. However, I am having one
difficulty: I have no knowledge of Banks-Zaks fields, and Unparticle
Physics is almost entirely based upon them. My university doesn't have a
subscription to the journal for that year, and I can't get the paper
without paying \$31.50. Now, I don't mean to whine or sound like a
cheapskate, but I eat mostly rice and boiled cabbage, so \$31.50 could
feed me for like two weeks. Plus, who ever heard of theoretical
physicists demanding monetary compensation for their ideas, and not
uploading their articles to arXiv? Crazy IP nazis. The paper I need is

"Perturbative-variational calculations of ground-state energies of lattice gauge theories"
==========================================================================================

by T. Banks and A Zaks, and it was published in 1982 in Nuclear Physics
B. If anyone has this paper, could you please send it my way?
