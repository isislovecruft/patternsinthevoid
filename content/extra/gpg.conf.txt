## Shut the fuck up:
no-greeting
no-emit-version
charset utf-8
display-charset utf-8
utf8-strings

## How to display keyids?:
keyid-format long

## If you have more than 1 secret key in your keyring, you may want to
## uncomment the following option and set your preferred keyid.
#default-key A3ADB67A2CDB8B35

## if you've got an offline key, use this to trust it:
trusted-key A3ADB67A2CDB8B35

## If you do not pass a recipient to gpg, it will ask for one.  Using
## this option you can encrypt to a default key.  Key validation will
## not be done in this case.  The second form uses the default key as
## default recipient.
# default-recipient some-user-id
#default-recipient-self

## Use --encrypt-to to add the specified key as a recipient to all
## messages.  This is useful, for example, when sending mail through a
## mail client that does not automatically encrypt mail to your key.
## In the example, this option allows you to read your local copy of
## encrypted mail that you've sent to others.

#encrypt-to A3ADB67A2CDB8B35

## The first one breaks Emacs EasyPG + ORG mode if you have more than one
## secret key.
hidden-encrypt-to A3ADB67A2CDB8B35
## Though this one can be used, as '--try-secret-key' to limit attempts to
## decrypt anonymously encrypted data to only using this key:
#try-secret-key A3ADB67A2CDB8B35

## Viewing Certifications & Keys
##-------------------------------

# When outputting certificates, view user IDs distinctly from keys:
fixed-list-mode

## You should always know at a glance which User IDs gpg thinks are
## legitimately bound to the keys in your keyring (show-uid-validity):
##
## The various 'show-notations' options display comments embedded in
## signatures and certifications.

verify-options no-show-photos show-uid-validity show-notations show-user-notations show-policy-urls show-keyserver-urls pka-lookups pka-trust-increase

## 1) no photographs (fuck libpng)
## 2) show me my trustdb calculation for the key
## 3) show expired/revoked uids (i might still want to use expired ones)
## 4) show expired/revoked subkeys
## 5-6) show all notations, include IETF standard ones, and user defined ones
## 7-8) show certification policy info and preferred keyserver urls
## 9) show signature expiration dates, if any
## 10) if used with --list-colons, show all signature subpackets
list-options no-show-photos show-uid-validity no-show-unusable-uids no-show-unusable-subkeys show-notations show-user-notations show-policy-urls show-keyserver-urls show-sig-expire show-sig-subpackets

## don't export photograph UIDs, so that we don't pass along this crap to
## others:
export-options no-export-attributes

# Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to ">From "
# it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
# cleartext signatures; all other PGP versions do it this way too.
#no-escape-from-lines

##     KEYSERVERS
##-----------------------
## Regular URL syntax applies, and you can set an alternate port
## through the usual method:
##      hkp://keyserver.example.net:22742
##
## Most users just set the name and type of their preferred keyserver.  Note
## that most servers (with the notable exception of ldap://keyserver.pgp.com)
## synchronize changes with each other.  Note also that a single server name
## may actually point to multiple servers via DNS round-robin.
## hkp://keys.gnupg.net is an example of such a "server", which spreads the
## load over a number of physical servers.  To see the IP address of the
## server actually used, you may use the "--keyserver-options debug".
##
## The last line in this file which starts with "keyserver" will specify the
## default keyserver to use.
##
## You need gnupg 1.4.10+ and gnupg-curl to use the SSL version of a keyserver.
##
## If you use an HKPS server, you'll need to tell gnupg/gnupg-curl where the
## CAcert is.  Under debian, you just have to add:
##    keyserver-options ca-cert-file=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificate.crt
##
## If you're running another (UNIX) OS, download the cacert certificate205
## (Class 1 PKI, PEM format should work), and add the line:
##    keyserver-options ca-cert-file=/path/where/you/downloaded/cacert/cert.pem
##
##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Normal keyservers:
##--------------------
keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net
keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
keyserver mailto:pgp-public-keys@keys.pgp.net
#keysever ldap://keyserver.pgp.com
keyserver pgp.mit.edu

## Indymedia Keyservers:

keyserver hkps://keys.indymedia.org
keyserver hkp://keys.indymedia.org

keyserver hkps://keys.mayfirst.org
keyserver hkp://keys.mayfirst.org

## Common options for keyserver functions:
##----------------------------------------
## include-disabled : when searching, include keys marked as "disabled" on the
##                    keyserver (not all keyservers support this).
## no-include-revoked : when searching, do not include keys marked as "revoked"
##                      on the keyserver.
## verbose : show more information as the keys are fetched.  Can be used more
##           than once to increase the amount of information shown.
## use-temp-files : use temporary files instead of a pipe to talk to the
##                  keyserver.  Some platforms (Win32 for one) always have this
##                  on.
## keep-temp-files : do not delete temporary files after using them (really
##                   only useful for debugging)
## http-proxy="proxy" : set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP keyservers.  This
##                      overrides the "http_proxy" environment variable, if
##                      any.
## auto-key-retrieve : automatically fetch keys as needed from the keyserver
##                     when verifying signatures or when importing keys that
##                     have been revoked by a revocation key that is not
##                     present on the keyring.
## no-include-attributes : do not include attribute IDs (aka "photo IDs") when
##                         sending keys to the keyserver.

## for use with parcimonie:
#keyserver-options http-proxy=socks://127.0.0.1:59050

# Use this program to display photo user IDs
#
# %i is expanded to a temporary file that contains the photo.
# %I is the same as %i, but the file isn't deleted afterwards by GnuPG.
# %k is expanded to the key ID of the key.
# %K is expanded to the long OpenPGP key ID of the key.
# %t is expanded to the extension of the image (e.g. "jpg").
# %T is expanded to the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg").
# %f is expanded to the fingerprint of the key.
# %% is %, of course.
#
# If %i or %I are not present, then the photo is supplied to the
# viewer on standard input.  If your platform supports it, standard
# input is the best way to do this as it avoids the time and effort in
# generating and then cleaning up a secure temp file.
#
# If no photo-viewer is provided, GnuPG will look for xloadimage, eog,
# or display (ImageMagick).  On Mac OS X and Windows, the default is
# to use your regular JPEG image viewer.
#
# Some other viewers:
# photo-viewer "qiv %i"
# photo-viewer "ee %i"
#
# This one saves a copy of the photo ID in your home directory:
# photo-viewer "cat > ~/photoid-for-key-%k.%t"
#
# Use your MIME handler to view photos:
# photo-viewer "metamail -q -d -b -c %T -s 'KeyID 0x%k' -f GnuPG"

photo-viewer "cat > ~/photoid-for-key-%f.%t"

# Passphrase agent
#
# We support the old experimental passphrase agent protocol as well as
# the new Assuan based one (currently available in the "newpg" package
# at ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/aegypten/).  To make use of the agent,
# you have to run an agent as daemon and use the option
#
# For Ubuntu we now use-agent by default to support more automatic
# use of GPG and S/MIME encryption by GUI programs.  Depending on the
# program, users may still have to manually decide to install gnupg-agent.

use-agent

# which tries to use the agent but will fallback to the regular mode
# if there is a problem connecting to the agent.  The normal way to
# locate the agent is by looking at the environment variable
# GPG_AGENT_INFO which should have been set during gpg-agent startup.
# In certain situations the use of this variable is not possible, thus
# the option
#
# --gpg-agent-info=<path>:<pid>:1
#
# may be used to override it.

# Automatic key location
#
# GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using the
# auto-key-locate option.  This happens when encrypting to an email
# address (in the "user@example.com" form), and there are no
# user@example.com keys on the local keyring.  This option takes the
# following arguments, in the order they are to be tried:
#
# cert = locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in RFC-4398.
#        GnuPG can handle both the PGP (key) and IPGP (URL + fingerprint)
#        CERT methods.
#
# pka = locate a key using DNS PKA.
#
# ldap = locate a key using the PGP Universal method of checking
#        "ldap://keys.(thedomain)".  For example, encrypting to
#        user@example.com will check ldap://keys.example.com.
#
# keyserver = locate a key using whatever keyserver is defined using
#             the keyserver option.
#
# You may also list arbitrary keyservers here by URL.
#
# Try CERT, then PKA, then LDAP, then hkp://subkeys.net:
#auto-key-locate keyserver cert pka hkp://subkeys.pgp.net

## If 'gpg --sign [...]' is called with:
##
## ∃!isisⒶwintermute:(master *$)~ ∴ gpg -a --clearsign \
##   -N "sig.count@patternsinthevoid.net=$(( `cat ~/.gnupg/sigs-0xA3ADB67A2CDB8B35/sig-count` + 1 ))" \
##   email.txt && \
##   { 
##     ns=$(( `cat ~/.gnupg/sigs-0xA3ADB67A2CDB8B35/sig-count` + 1 )) ;
##     echo -n "$ns" |& tee > ~/.gnupg/sigs-0xA3ADB67A2CDB8B35/sig-count ;
##   } && \
##   { 
##     d=`date +"%s"`;
##     cd ~/.gnupg/sigs-0xA3ADB67A2CDB8B35 && \
##         {
##           git add ~/.gnupg/sigs-0xA3ADB67A2CDB8B35/sig-count && \
##           git commit -q -S -m "$d $ns" </dev/null ;
##         } && \
##         git push origin master ;
##   };
##
## then the '-N' will set a new signature notation for the signature being
## created on the 'email.txt' file. This added signature notation which will
## include the signature counter stored in the file '~/.gnupg/sig-count',
## incremented by one. If the creation of this signature is successful, the
## increased counter is then written to '~/.gnupg/sig-count'. Then, the
## sig-count file is add to a commit which has an UE timestamp and the current
## signature count in the commit message, and this commit is signed with
## another gpg signature, and pushed to a remote server.
##
## Then, we can set the signature keyserver:
