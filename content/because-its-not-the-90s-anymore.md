Scan the barcode for my contact information.

Setting up mass anonymous accounts which all reference each other for
verification is fun! Especially the part about getting the SIP account
to forward to a PSTN number to set up a Google Voice account. And I
didn't have to spend a dime -- take that, The Man!

EDIT: I don't use most of these accounts, and some I have purposefully
shut down. Email is where it's at.
