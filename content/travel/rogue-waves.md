The TSA agent had just finished running their fingers through my hair, and
begun to pat down my shoulders and outstretched arms.

> "So... do you live in Washington D.C.?" they asked.

I shook my head, no. They asked what I was doing in the capitol. I responded,
in my politest, most innocent, most mousy-little-girl voice:

> "I'm just going to talk to some of our nation's senators about my work."

The TSA agent jumped back a bit.

> "Oh? What do you do?"

> "I'm a programmer and computer security researcher."

> "Oh! Are you like really smart? I saw things about this on TV. Do you like
> break code and stuff?"

> "Perhaps, sometimes. But, you know... I can't really talk about it."

I forced my face into what I hoped was a kind and knowing half-smile.

They seemed utterly shocked.

> "Well then, good luck with your talks, miss, and you're free to go."

they said, both forgetting to pat down the remainder of me, and to put the
baby blue latex gloves into the machine that purportedly checks for chemical
compounds used in explosives.

I coolly walked away, holding my nose up in the air, as if I believed I had
every right in the world to not be humiliatingly groped, holding all my
snickering giddiness inside until I got around the corner of a head-high
dividing wall. Then I shook my head, shocked at myself and feeling somewhat
bad and for the multiple lies² that had just fallen out of my mouth before I
could even think about them, and I laughed out loud, wondering how long it
would take for that person to realise they still had their gloves on.

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">&middot &middot &middot</p>

That evening, arriving at the hotel in Washington D.C. for the
[Open Tech Fund](https://www.opentechfund.org/) summit meeting, I spotted
[Moxie](https://thoughtcrime.org/) in the lobby through the glass doors; I ran
inside, dropping my backpack, and flung myself upwards at him to wrap my arms
around his shoulders. Moxie had been talking with two others: Trevor from the
[Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/), and
Zooko of [Tahoe-LAFS](https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs). I awkwardly
waved a friendly hello at Trevor, and since I'd only "met" Zooko over
videochat before, I awkwardly hugged them for the first time. Inwardly, I
mentally kicked myself again for my shyness around people I should be able to
call comrades and cohorts, yet haven't interacted with as much AFK.

We sat down in the hotel lobby, exhausted and idly chatting. Moxie and I, as
usual, got to one of our lifelong favourite topics.

> "So I was down in Malibu, and I ran into Laird Hamilton... you know that
> guy?" Moxie asked.

Yep. Dude surfs *crazy huge* waves. I'd run into him before. Moxie continued:

> "I just finished this book about rogue waves -- they're these monster waves,
> hundreds of feet tall, pretty much unpredictable. There's whole conferences
> that people go to -- people like us -- but instead of talking about crypto,
> all they do is talk about rogue waves."

Moxie's eyes lit up as he said,

> "Some people even survive these things... but the folks who survive, they're
> always the lunatics who saw the wall of water coming, and made a mad dash
> straight for it."

I think the rest of us could sense one of Moxie's sailor stories coming, so we
smiled, nodded, and let him monologue. If someone were to follow Moxie around
and collect his
sometimes-rather-dubious-but-you're-willing-to-suspend-all-doubt-for-the-sheer-entertainment-value¹
sailor stories, they'd have a NYT Best Seller in no time.

> "So this one wave, something like sixteen hundred feet high, hit the coast
> of Alaska in the 1960s... and there are still survivors alive today to tell
> the tale. Can you imagine? Sitting there in the harbour, on your little
> fishing boat, and you see a sixteen hundred foot wall of water coming
> towards you, and you've still got the wherewithal to jet the engines and
> head directly into it?"

Moment of silence in reverent awe.

>
> "Sure enough, one day, a storm hits, and Laird calls his buddy up: 'Dude,

Moxie's eyes were fervently glowing like a right proper madman.

> "They go back out there."

I smiled my appreciation at Moxie's energetic storytelling, and sat quietly,
wondering if the similarities between the cypherpunks and these people
obsessed with giant waves extended beyond just the conferences.

I mentioned that I lied² multiple times to that TSA agent.

I don't³ work for any government agency. As hilarious as I think it is that
the TSA agent actually believed I worked for (presumably) the NSA, I
haven't. Nor have I worked for any other agency of the U.S. government, nor
any other government.⁴

And I also lied about visiting Congress. I've already written about
[my previous experience visiting senators and representatives on Capitol Hill](../congress-not-the-chaos-computer-club-kind.html).
The head of OTF kindly poked me to attend their "Hill Day" again -- the yearly
field trip which led to those previously mentioned adventures, where a bunch
of crazy internet-freedom hackers go to Capitol Hill to explain their work to
U.S. senators, representatives, and their aides -- but seeing as there was
limited space for the Hill Day, I opted out of diving through that wave for
the second time in order to give someone else⁵ a go at it.

What I didn't realise was that many people had read my previous post and
expected Capitol Hill to be full of trolls. While this is mostly true, and
while I really, *really* want to be able to say nothing more than that
Congress is full of a bunch of asshats who accidentally open their
`passwords.txt` file on the monitor in front of me⁶, instead I'd like to tell
the story of a positive interaction I had on that day two years ago...

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">&middot &middot &middot</p>

It was a full day, playing the part of a door-to-door salesman selling
censorship-circumvention and privacy software, like some futurist's worst
nightmare -- straight out of a Gibson or Doctorow novel -- trudging through
metal detectors and underground tunnels beneath the Rayburn House and other
Congressional office buildings, before I arrived in that Senator's office. I'd
been busy spouting my well-rehearsed introductions to anyone important-looking
who would hold still for thirty seconds. I'd entertained myself mostly by
snickering at the sheer abundance of ridiculous articles of clothing which I
was encountering -- a photograph of some of these things could have made a
tweet all in itself, perhaps complemented, drily, wittily, writhingly, by the
simplicity of a `#wtf` or a `#onlyindc` hashtag: American flag high heels,
pink and baby blue powersuits, and chintzy red-white-and-blue 1970s-styled
silk neckties.

And, of course, the entertainment value provided by pretending to be
legitimately concerned over the rumoured possibility of Reptilians in the
underground tunnels of the nation's capitol should not be left unstated. I
kept my eyes very widely and very noticeably peeled, such that any casual
observer or surveillance camera which might happen to spy on me in those
tunnels couldn't help but *instantly* understand that I was comprised of
nothing but the most utmost awareness of my surrounding environment: a single
glimpse of a scaly green tail whisking around a corner, a set of pupils
converting to the yellowy narrowed slits of a reptile in between blinks, the
slightest hiss from an underground chamber whose door was mistakenly left
unlatched -- I would make certain that any secrets that were down here,
*they'd know* that *I knew* about them.

The Senator's office reeked of Folgers coffee, clean carpets, and
paperwork. We walked in, greeted by a tall, Texan man in his mid-twenties. He
was dressed in faded Levi's and a plaid flannel shirt. His biceps said he'd
once quarterbacked for the high-school football team. My first thought was,

> "Oh, fuck me. Today's gonna end with me hitting this dude in the face."

Our funder had split all us hackers up into smaller groups that morning. As
should be expected from anyone familiar with the normative ratios in hacker
circles, I was the only female-bodied person in my group, which neither
bothered⁷ me nor surprised me in the slightest. It's just a FactOfLife™.⁸

What did surprise me was this plaided Texan. Speaking directly to me, he said,

> "Hi! You must be Isis, from the Tor Project. I'm a big fan of your work!"

A bit shocked that anyone from Texas had heard of either me or the Tor
Project, I thanked him and shook his hand. Some other members of the group
tried to introduce themselves. He shushed them with a handwave and continued
speaking directly to me:

> "So... you write Python, yeah? And, of course, you're really good with
> security... I'm releasing this web app for the Senator tomorrow, and I'm
> really nervous about it and kinda wondering if you could take a look at my
> code?"

Inside my brain, there were some noises like frantic footsteps on a hardwood
floor and some confused shuffling of papers, and then a chorus of voices all
saying in unison: *"Wat."* This kid? Write code?

Sceptical, I followed, sitting in the mahogany leather chair studded with
brass rivets he had pointed me into, next to him, behind a giant,
darkly-stained oak desk. His Macbook was sitting open on the desk. A couple of
Vim buffers lay open before me. I hated *absolutely everything* he stood for.

> "It's a perhaps a little bit late for an audit, if you're deploying
> tomorrow." I warned.

> "Well, it's already live on the server... it's just that we decided to
> open-source it, so I'm making it public on Github tomorrow."

I stared at his cowboy boots. Two of the voices in my brain were whispering
back and forth to each other:

> "Open source?"
>
> "Did he just say 'open source'?"
>
> "I dunno... we probably just misheard him."
>
> "Perhaps he meant 'Congress is a bunch of open sores'... ?"

My own inner-voice interrupted, telling them to STFU.

One of the other hackers from the group tried to introduce themselves and
their project again. More handwaving from the plaided Texan. Silence again.

We started looking over the code, a mixture of Python, Django templates, and
Javascript. I pointed out a bunch of little things as I spotted them, like
moving to a more recent version of Django to better avoid
[some of the then-recent CSRF, XSS, and DoS vulnerabilities](http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-10199/product_id-18211/year-2011/Djangoproject-Django.html). I
complimented him on his clean use of Javascript scopes and avoidance of global
variable manipulation, pointed out some places where perhaps the Python code
could be more functionalised to avoid code duplication, and suggested adding a
bit more developer documentation and recommended trying
[Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). Just little things. Overall, it looked
pretty good.

The whole time, he was kind and patient when I appeared to misunderstand
something, intelligent in his explanations for particular segments of code and
rationales for overarching design choices, and slightly *nervous*, as if he
was sincerely worried that I might find some issue and rail against him for
writing shitty, insecure code. He wasn't just showing off his
perfectly-cultivated pet project to me to try get attention. Even more
impressive: he spoke directly *with me* the entire time. In a room full of
boys. Boys who concern themselves primarily with coding and security, no
less. And -- not to be misandrist -- boys who continually tried to interrupt
the conversation to provide their own input (which, I should add, was more
than welcome on my end... after all, it's possible I'd missed something). In a
good way, I was shocked. And impressed. And then further shocked at myself
that I was impressed.

> "So... this is some sort of app for collaborative editing, like a wiki,
> right?"

I probingly asked out of curiosity, wondering why anyone would feel the need
to reinvent *that* particular wheel again.

> "Yep! It's a site which allows members of Congress to upload proposed
> legislature for the public to collaboratively edit, mark up, and make
> suggestions for. Experts too can point out new and relevant research in
> their fields which might be pertinent to the amendment and creation of laws,
> lawyers can highlight sections which are confusingly or troublingly worded,
> and anyone can voice their opinions." he explained.

I thought of bills like SOPA.

> "Hmm... so if someone were to login, click to edit a bill, highlight the whole
> text input field, hit BACKSPACE, and then click SAVE... what would that
> do?"

He cocked his head sideways and stared at me inquisitively. *"That... would
create a revision... in which the whole bill would be erased."* he answered,
slowly, seemingly not understanding why someone might wish to make such a
political statement.

We got to talking about login and authentication schemes, and, in some sense,
matters of identity. Who should be permitted to edit this legislature?
Currently implemented mechanisms were, of course, poorly-designed and
insufficient to prove requisite authorisation to edit a proposed bill. And
even worse in the case that such a system were to be used for smaller scales,
like state or city legislature. Requiring an image of a U.S. passport or
state-issued driver's licence would pose enormous data-retention and privacy
issues.

> "But is there actually crypto that can do authentication like that safely?"
> he asked.

I remember that, somehow, through a series of questions and answers, I wound
up explaining things like Bitcoin's demonstrated solution to the consensus
issues posed by the Byzantine General's Problem, the basics of some of
[my favourite anonymous credential schemes](https://people.torproject.org/~isis/papers/rBridge:%20User%20Reputation%20based%20Tor%20Bridge%20Distribution%20with%20Privacy%20Preservation.copy%20with%20notes.pdf),
and how such schemes combined might someday be used to create anonymous
electronic identification cards for a system of global, opt-in,
techno-panarchist States:

> "So, for example, you could be a member of the Republican State, protected
> by it and paying taxes to it, regardless of where you live, travel, or work.
> You'd be free to discuss and vote on issues anonymously, truly speaking your
> mind, unhindered by any worries that your political views might one day
> become unsavoury and be used against you. And conversely, someone like me: I
> would be able to opt-in (or out) of whichever State, or collective
> association, as I saw fit, and be taxed accordingly for my use of whatever
> public services I'd signed up for. Most importantly, each person could have
> strong, cryptographic protection of their identity, their associations, and
> perhaps even proof that they had payed whatever taxes they had opted into."

I remember shyly looking up from the stitched patterns on his cowboy boots at
this point, slightly embarrassed that so many words which might easily
convince someone that I was mentally unstable had poured out of my mouth. And
I remember the look on the Texan hacker's face: eyes wide, head tilted again
to the side, mouth agape, *mind completely blown*. He said nothing. He
continued to say nothing, and it seemed like this was probably going to take
him a while.

This was painful. I really liked this guy. And I absolutely *hated* that I
couldn't help liking him. I wanted to hate him, goddammit. He was like, you
know, *the enemy*.

But so what if maybe he didn't understand my crazy-anarchist politics or my
decision to never brush my hair and grow dreads down to my knees? I didn't
agree with his Macbook or understand how he could maintain any typing accuracy
with his bulgy quarterback biceps. But differences aside, this guy was a good
coder, was extremely respectful of female-bodied people and willing to engage
them on a technical level, and was willing to write a web app which permitted
-- as ineffectual as I suspect such a statement would be -- people like me to
voice their opinions, publicly and equally.

I guess I suppose *grumble* that maybe there are *grumble* a few decent people
*grumble* on Capitol Hill.

For what it's worth, I don't remember the name of the plaided Texan I spoke
with on that day two years ago, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but I
strongly suspect that it was [Jeremy Carbaugh](https://github.com/jcarbaugh)
of the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/team/jcarbaugh/),
and that the web app in question was
[PublicMarkup](http://www.publicmarkup.org/),
[the code for which is available on Github](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/publicmarkup).

<p style="font-size: 80%">¹ I'm thinking specifically the one with the cop
trying to arrest Moxie for carrying a closed wine bottle onto a sailboat in a
harbour, while an ongoing Navy exercise in the water is using trained
dolphins strapped with explosives to rocket a scuba-driving Navy Seal out of
the water and up into the air, where other Navy Seals on a boat practice
gunning him down.</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%">² Upon proofreading this post, a friend suggested
that I not retroactively "misterm" actions which were not, legally speaking
"lying" <i>per se</i>, in a way which could potentially be considered an
admission of the crime of lying to a federal agent, and suggested that I
should instead say that "I insinuated misinformation to the TSA agent." While
I <i>am</i> slightly anxious about making a blog post containing what could be
construed as an admission to a crime which I didn't commit... on the other
hand -- because I can't say the phrase "insinuated misinformation" with a
straight face without making an IngSoc doublespeak reference -- I'm going to
leave my post as-is.</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%">³ Unless, of course, you're one of the rather
annoyingly naïve conspiracy theorist assholes who just got on the Internet for
the first time to write drivel for <a

count contracting to non-profits like the <a href="https://leap.se/">LEAP
Encryption Access Project</a> and the <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor
Project</a> as somehow "working for the U.S. government", despite both projects
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/financials.html.en">being very clear
about whom they receive grant funding from and for what purposes</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%">⁴ And following <a
href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2012-May/001344.html">Mike
Perry's frequent examples</a>, I'd also like to take this opportunity to hold
my <i>I've-never-received-a-National-Security-Letter</i> card high in the air
while I still can.

<p style="font-size: 80%">⁵ I hear that Mike Perry enjoys getting his feet
wet. Perhaps he'll write something about it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%">⁶ Story for another time.</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%">⁷ Because I can hear the other feminists yelling at
me as I write this: by "not bothered" I mean that "I've become much too much
accustomed to this to feel personally offended at this particular incident."

<p style="font-size: 80%">⁸ Where the word "life" is instead taken to mean
"the current deranged sociocultural arrangement in which female persons are
coerced in innumerable ways to assume that they are intrinsically ill-adept
