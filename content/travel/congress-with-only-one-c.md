Title: Congress. Not the Chaos Computer Club kind.

One of Tor's funders convinced me to visit the Hill. I explained that this was
a terrible, no-good, very-bad idea. I think they thought it would be funny.

This one pickled tampon of a woman, what's her name...Shanna Winters. Chief
Counsel to the Subcommittee on The Courts, Internet and Intellectual Property,
chaired by Congressman Howard Berman. There were five of us developers,
introducing ourselves, like five minutes into the meeting, and I said,

> "Hi! I'm Isis; I'm with the Tor Project, and through RFA I'm working on
> OONI, which is going to be a globally deployed censorship detection framework,
> the results of which will be published as open data."

So many friendly buzzwords. How could she possibly be against *all of the
buzzwords*? Immediately, Winters says, *"And what about porn?"* I thought that
she'd misheard me, so I said, *"I'm sorry?"*

> "What about porn?"

> "Uh… I'm afraid I don't understand the context. What *about* porn?"

> "Does your tool provide people a way to get around blocks?"

> "No and yes. No: it provides data on how the block has been implemented. Yes:
> that data can be used by projects which create censorship circumvention tools
> to better adapt their tools to the context at hand."

> "But you agree that porn should be blocked?"

I stared at her. And then I stared at her some more. Then I refrained from
asking what kind of porn she was into. And then I was just speechless, because
I couldn't tell if she was trolling. I just stared at her. I don't think I
blinked.

I continue to stare for another full minute, running through a checklist of
strategies and calculating probability distributions for items including:

  - Have they studied game theory?
  - Can I explain game theory?
  - Will they understand what a Pareto suboptimal outcome is?
  - Can I explain that there are two Pareto suboptimal outcomes to the game
    they are playing?
  - Do they understand networking?
  - Do understand catastrophe theory?
  - Can I explain state transformation matrices and unstable states?
  - Wait, *do they understand math*?!?
  - If they don't understand math, how do I explain anything to them?
  - Wait, *how* do they *know* anything?
  - *Do* they know anything?

I must have stared at her for a solid minute trying to assess if I should
attempt to explain to her that censorship is an unstable arms race with two
Pareto suboptimal outcomes:

One, a network connected to the rest of the globe with (mostly) no blocks of
any kind, with hackers working on all kinds of things, including better and
safer technologies, as well as ways to break and exploit those
technologies.

Or, two, you have no hackers, no circumventions, no trite cyberwar, no pr0n,
whatever, because you have no network. None. Not even unencrypted HTTP over
port 80. Because as soon as there is a path to a server with something
interesting on it, I assure you, we'll get to it. We'll use pluggable
transports to transmogrify our traffic; we'll hijack and spoof identifying
headers for anything you whitelist; we'll even pop your boxes if we have
to. As long as there is a network, you're going to have hackers. And as long
as that network doesn't allow everyone to ask any and all questions about the
world, receive answers to those questions, and explore ideas (yes, even
sexually explicit and politically unsavory ones, you uneducated, endemic,
parochial, fascist in a blue velvet powersuit). You might think you're
omnipotent sitting up there on your little Hill, and unfortunately that may
near well be the case -- with your frequent and flagrant tramplings of
free-means-absolutely-free-for-everyone-everywhere-at-all-times speech,
consent, and voluntary association,² the torpidity you instill with your
bumbling, opaque hands and greedy state corporatism into the market, the
numerous existential threats you pose to humanity and its successors through
your rape of the commons and inhibition of scientific progress… you might
think. But you're not. Because the one thing you won't ever censor, you won't
ever build a prison for, you won't inhibit is ingenuity. As I said, two Pareto
suboptimal outcomes.


 ¹ I'd add "human" "rights", but I really don't want to digress into semantics.
 ² Is it permissible to use gendered words when you *do* mean to disrespect a
fascist bitch?
