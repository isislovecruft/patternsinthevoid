Not random. I've seen you around.

Neat neat neat. May the winds be at your heels.

Well, I don't know your gender or sex, but I am female (even though I think
I'm a boy on the inside, I present as feminine). This seems to be an unfair
advantage while hitchhiking. 

In the USA, traveler kids also ride freight trains, but I understand this is
not a thing in Europe. Trains are nicer, in my opinion, because you don't have
to talk to anybody or listen to anyone's crappy music. That said, I get along
with random people in Europe *much* better than I get along with random
Americans, so it's not too much of an issue. But I guess my point is that
appearing non-threatening while hitchhiking (or traveling with a friend who is
sufficiently so, times two) can be useful. And if you're experienced
hitchhiking then you already know this, but "*speak softly and carry a large
stick*". It's only come up twice now while hitchhiking, in about ten years,
that I've had to use the stick.

Hmm. For me it is a balancing act. I have a neurological disorder, and a
genetically-acquired immunological disorder, so I have to be really careful
about everything I eat/drink/smoke/consume and what situations I get myself
into. If I stay in one place for too long, I can become very crazy and
somewhat incoherent. If I travel too much, I get too stressed out and the same
thing happens. 

I usually end up repetitively reminding myself of a few things:

 * Everything is a game, and there is always a non-NIL chance of winning.

 * The x is real, and the x will actually hurt you, where
     { x : x = cars | water | airsharks | cops | feds | guns | tanks }.
   Alternatively phrased: "If you die in [insert_city], you die in real life."

 * Don't trust anyone over 30. (Including yourself, if you're over 30.)

 * Yes, you must brush your teeth for at least two minutes, twice per day. No
   "but"s, "and"s, or "if"s: unix-beardo breath is not okay.

Other random things which prove helpful in the long run:

 * Anti-microbial microfiber hiking/biking socks and underwear. They dry
   really fast, are easy to wash, last forever, are less smelly, and less
   likely to give you bootrot or jockitch or whatever gross other thing.

 * Those pocket-sized, microfiber, magical traveling towels. I have no idea
   how they soak up so much liquid.

 * Smelling like a real human is awesome, but using non-scented anti-microbial
   deoderant will make laundry day come less often. Don't worry too much about
   being smelly, just don't let the smell get crustified into your clothes.

 * Waterproof backpacks, #FTW. Also, pockets, pouches, resizeable carrying
   containers, and backpacking compression bags #FTW. For the past two years,
   [This backpack](http://missionworkshop.com/products/arkiv-system-bags/VX-R8-field-pack-overview.php)
   has carried everything I own (mostly electronics, notebooks of equations,
   and clothes) through downpour in the scottish highlands, through a kowloon
   monsoon, into the amazonian rainforest, through part the alps in winter on
   foot, aboard multiple ships and sailboats, through multiple deserts, on
   several bicycles in all weather (including a couple bike crashes where I
   landed on one of my laptops and it survived). It's still going as strong as
   the day I got it. Also, the padded laptop bag extension to it, if you undo
   the lining, take out the padding, and staple layers of aluminum foil to it,
   it becomes a pretty solid Faraday cage.

 * If you have access to power, plug things in. And having the
   [laptop-mode-tools](http://packages.debian.org/sid/laptop-mode-tools)
   package [configured correctly](http://samwel.tk/laptop_mode/faq) will help
   you immensely. Training yourself also to do various tricks like:

        [cmd to do when network is available] >> ~/no-internets.sh

   helps too. Basically anything to save power, and learn to live without
   constant access to internet.

 * Have something to read and something to take notes with at all
   times. Unfortunately, this usually means paper. There will be times when
   you have to wait ten or fifteen minutes for something to happen; now is not
   the time to start coding, but do have something to make the time pass
   faster which wastes neither battery nor brain cells.

 * When crossing borders, by any means of transport whatsoever, do not keep
   unencrypted copies of any data whatsoever. Especially not photos of friends
   or where you've been, contact info, PGP fingerprints of people you've met,
   etc. Or, rather, if you are to keep unencrypted data, make it junk to
   obfuscate your datatrail, i.e. photos of random people you've never met
   with the exif data rewritten, contact info and hotel addresses for cities
   you were never in, etc. Or data for trolling, like photos named
   "747engine_diagram.png" and "washingtondc_tunnels.png" which are really
   just pictures of cats. Bonus points if you shittily steganographically
   encode or shittily encrypt to make the border authorities work harder for
   the extra lulz.

 * Learn at least the following phrases in whatever languages you'll come
   across:
       * "thank you"
       * "no thank you"
       * "please"
       * "you're welcome"
       * "I'm looking for..."
       * "I need to get to..."
       * "I am called..."
       * "how much does it cost"
       * "I'll skullfuck you"
       * "get the hell away from me"
       * "my <language> is crappy. do you speak <language>?"

   Being able to write these down helps, if you can't pronounce things
   understandably. And being aware of cultural implications of writiing things
   down. For example, I can write some kanji, but no one my age *actually*
   remembers how to handwrite Chinese -- everyone only remembers what motions
   to make on the keyboard on their mobile device, then they select the
   correct kanji from a short autocomplete list. When I wrote things down on
   paper in China and Japan, I never got any answers, only amazement at my
   handwriting. Same thing in Tunisia.

 * Most people are nice, and actually mean well. If they don't mean well,
   humour always helps. And if humour doesn't help, very clearly stating that
   you want nothing to do with them very loudly is probably the next best
   thing to try.

 * Cops are not people. Talking to them gains you nothing. See
   [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE) by a Harvard Law
   professor if you're not already convinced of this. Many can be outrun,
   others can be bribed. When trying the latter, be sure to agree on the price
   *before* pulling out money. (And only keep in your wallet what you're
   willing to lose.)

 * Devise a scheme for crossing very malicious borders (i.e. England, United
   States, and various cronies these countries) without having any accessible
   passwords/keys. For me, this has meant:

       1. Create a new keypair, Ke.
       2. Encrypt data d with your own public key, from keypair Ka. Call this
          output x.
       3. Encrypt x with the public key of Ke. Call the output y.
       4. Encrypt the private key of Ke to the public key of Kb, which is
          the keypair of a friend, B. (It can be helpful if B will be in the
          next safe city you'll be in. Also helpful to pick friends whose keys
          you've already certified, and who are good at not losing their
          keys/passwords.) Call this output z.
       5. Send (y||z) to B (or store (y||z) somewhere difficult to break into,
          like on [Tahoe-LAFS](https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs)
          nodes). Bonus points if you find a good way to send (y||z) to B
          without anyone else being able to discover who B is, or if you wrap
          y in another layer of encryption to a different friend and send them
          the data, and still send the encryption key Ke to B.

   In this way, to get at your data, the border authorities will likely need
   to beat you up to find out where the data is (or get the keys to get to
   it). Likely the interrogation stops there because they can't easily
   retrieve data in an outside jurisdiction. If it doesn't, they then need to
   track down your friends(s), and compell them in some manner to give up the
   data and their keys. If it reaches this point, hopefully you're no longer
   in the custody of the border authorities, because once they've retrieved
   your data and your friend(s) keys, they'll need your keys and passwords to
   decrypt again.

   If part of the data you send to your friend is your own signing/certifying
   key, it's especially helpful if your friend will be in the same city that
   you'll be arriving in. Otherwise, you'll have no way to prove to your
   friend that you actually made it across the border and are not currently
   under duress.

   (There's probably some easier and better way to do this; this is just what
   I do. Also, I'm not a lawyer, and I don't pretend to have any special
   knowledge of laws pertaining to these matters anywhere. Not that having
   such knowledge does any good at all -- countries and authorities only make
   the laws, they don't follow them.)

You might like reading one of my partners' blogs, another anarchist traveler,
named [Margaret Killjoy](http://birdsbeforethestorm.net) (a.k.a. Magpie) who
does graphic design, book design/editing, and publishes/writes for AK Press
and other good people. They care a bit less about security things, though I've
convinced them to use FDE, GPG, and OTR.

No problem. I should probably post this stuff, you are the fourth person this
week to ask me for this info.

Thanks. Hopefully I'll get to verify it someday. :)
