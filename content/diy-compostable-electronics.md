Here's another reason why nanotechnology is awesome and [primitivists
are not awesome][]: [organic electronics][].

They're made of carbon nanotubules, and can be printed with an infrared
laser onto a normal CD or DVD. Granted, normal CDs are not organic by
any means, or compostable, but these researcher intend to figure out a
way to change that. This technology is amazing, it would allow normal
folks to literally print out their own completely organic electronics at
home, and eliminates the need for inorganic materials such as silicon
and copper in modern electronics.

Imagine a 3D printer made with this technology! I don't even know if
that's possible, but I like the idea of making an organic body for my AI
to live in.
