[![][]][]Working off of a series of workshop that friends and I have
done for various activist groups to teach basic digital security, I've
begun to put up pages outlining the steps taken in these workshops.

As of right now, the [basic security tutorials][] for Windows and Linux
are done, and Mac users could probably follow along and just look up the
software and configurations for OSX. I'll get the Mac page done as soon
as possible, and I'll probably have a chance to work on the advanced
security pages after [Defcon][].

And thanks again to everyone who has worked with me, everyone who has
contributed to educating other activists on security issues, and all the
activists out there risking their health, safety, and happiness to make
the world better.

Have fun, everyone, and be safe(r).
