[![][]][]In order to determine the particular constituents which cause
gravitation between, and understand the congruence of, various occult
groups and fascist ideology, it seemed to be an initial necessity for a
prolegomenon to linearize an exegesis on the evolution, or cosmogony, of
fascist thinking within the general population. However, my preliminary
research on the matter yielded an inextricable tangle of fascist and
occult theory. To set forth a basic hypothesis, I should speculate that
fascism and occultism are both, more or less, esoteric and highly
intellectualized reactions to rationalist and materialist doctrines.
However, I am inclined to believe that this entanglement is one that
spans several centuries and may very well be rooted deep within the
archetypes of primitive religions. Perhaps once an understanding of the
congruence between occult and fascist ideologies is obtained, an appeal
can be made for the suitable juxtaposition of anarchism and occultism.

Broadly characterized, all philosophies can be relegated into one of two
primary and distinct categories, which are defined by their opposite
secernments. These primary categories are Idealism and Materialism. The
philosophical theory of materialism holds that the only thing that
exists is matter, without any true spiritual or intellectual
existence.^[1]^Within materialist philosophy, all phenomena (including
consciousness) are the result of material interactions.^[2]^ Within
science and religion, materialist theory yields determinism, the belief
in causality. In psychology, materialist theory yields behaviorism, the
belief that matter cannot influence mind. Of particular interest here
are the sociological interpretations of materialism, namely the types of
cultural materialism found within the Marxist tradition. On the one
hand, Marxist Dialectical Materialism holds that concepts and ideas are
the result of material conditions, more specifically, that the means of
production and distribution within a society determines the ideological
tenets of that society. On the other hand, Marxist Historical
Materialism asserts that the influential members of society hold sway on
the material condition, while society's social institutions are founded
upon the material condition.^[3]^

It was during the Crisis of Marxism in the 1890s that the political
theory of Fascism emerged. Economic theorist David Ramsay Steele writes
on the evolution of fascist theory:

An anonymous Satanist author propounds that Fascism was not only
parallel to Occultism, but was derived from it: “Fascism arose as a
revolt against the rationalism of the 18th and 19^th^ centuries. The
First World War struck at the depths of the psyche, and plunged the
rationalist world view into disarray and a retreat that saw its grand
vision of a "League of Nations" dashed. The spread of occult societies
during the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th centuries
was likewise a response to the sterility of the rationalism and
materialism. It is not surprising then that the ground for Fascism was
largely prepared by esoteric societies which arose in Europe. Among
these were the New Templars of Von Liebenfels, the Runic order of Von
List, and the German Order [Germanenorden]. The latter gave rise to the
Thule Society, which was to establish the NSDAP as its political front.”
^[5]^

Taking these considerations into account, the most probable exegesis of
fascism is that it, firstly, occurred as a revolutionary reaction to the
materialism of Marxist philosophy, and that in this reactionary
dissidence it sought more mythological and idealistic ideologies, which
brought it to the bounds of occultism. Occultism, then, in turn, saw
fascism as a means towards hastened ideological revolution, what was
commonly termed Aeonic Revolution. However, there is evidence that
secret orders such as the Germanenorden and the Thule Society were
coerced by a mass influx of Nazi neophytes into espousing racist or
anti-Semitic beliefs.^[6]^ Whether it was occult societies which
influenced the emerging fascists or the fascists who influenced certain
occult societies is controversial, and perhaps may always be so.

![][3]Regardless of historical entanglement between the two groups,
there currently exists occult orders embracing fascism as a means toward
hastened social and individual evolution. Often such extremist
hierarchical structures are explained as being nearer to the supposed
state-of-nature than current political structures. It is perhaps
unnecessary to point out that this logical argument commits the
naturalistic fallacy.^[7]^ The above mentioned anonymous Satanic author
explains that, “Despite the phenomenon of Neo-Paganism (properly so
called to distinguish it from Paganism per se), of wicca and New Age
pacifist, cosmopolitan, internationalist creeds, there are today today a
plethora of genuinely Pagan societies which remain true to the
tribalist, warrior ethos of their ancestors. They are 'Satanist' or
'sinister' in that they recognise the dark, entropic force of Nature,
the cyclic ebb and flow of history, and the creative act of destruction.
These 'sinister' esoteric societies proclaim the 'Daemonic revolution',
to usher in the New Order on the collapse of the Old; a New Order that
will reawaken the Dark soul of man, that he might live as a totality
with the Light and the Dark returned to balance. These esoteric
societies recognize Fascism (whether called by that name of not) as the
political expression of primal truths. They include The Black Order of
Pan-Europa, Fraternity of Balder, Order of Nine Angles, Abraxas
Foundation, Blood Axis...All such groups are playing their part in the
unfolding of Aeonic destiny and the approach of Ragnarok. Fenrir is
about to be unleashed!”^[8]^

The appeal to certain “primal truths” closely mirrors the
state-of-nature theory of Benedictus de Spinoza, from “On the
foundations of the state” in *Theological-Political Treatise*:![][4]

> “By the right and order of nature I merely mean the rules determining
> the nature of each individual thing by which we conceive it is
> determined naturally to exist and to behave in a certain way. For
> example fish are determined by nature to swim and big fish to eat
> little ones, and therefore it is by sovereign natural right that fish
> have possession of the water and that big fish eat small fish. For it
> is certain that nature, considered wholly in itself, has a sovereign
> right to do everything that it can do, i.e., the right of nature
> extends as far as its power extends...However, since the universal
> power of the whole of nature is nothing but the power of all
> individual things together, it follows that each individual thing has
> the sovereign right to do everything that it can do, or the right of
> each thing extends so far as its determined power extends.” ^[9]^

However, the argument for the individual within the state-of-nature can
be utilized towards both fascist theory and anarchist theory. For
instance, political theorist Robert Nozick, in *Anarchy, State, and
Utopia*, opines the relative unjustness and inordinateness of any amount
of government beyond a minimalist libertarian structure, outlining and
analyzing the various stages of development from individuals in
isolation to hierarchical government.^[10]^In fact, if we are to ignore
the naturalistic fallacy within, this argument appears to lend more
credence to individualist anarchism than fascism, whose roots and
rhetoric are entirely anti-individualist. David Ramsey Steele comments:

> “As the dictatorship [Mussolini's] matured, Fascist rhetoric
> increasingly voiced explicit hostility to the individual ego. Fascism
> had always been strongly communitarian but now this aspect became more
> conspicuous. Fascist anti-individualism is summed up in the assertion
> that the death of a human being is like the body's loss of a cell.
> Among the increasingly histrionic blackshirt meetings from 1920 to
> 1922 were the funeral services. When the name of a comrade recently
> killed by the Socialists was called out, the whole crowd would roar:
> *"Presente!"*
>
> Man is not an atom, man is essentially social--these woolly clichés
> were as much Fascist as they were socialist. Anti-individualism was
> especially prominent in the writings of official philosopher Giovanni
> Gentile, who gave Fascist social theory its finished form in the final
> years of the regime.” ^[11]^

If the state-of-nature argument for the suitability of the application
of fascist politics towards social evolution is to be disregarded for
its erroneous qualities, then precisely what is it that causes a
convergence between various strains of occultism and fascism? A possible
answer is that both ideologies shared two similar common goals: the
creation of a Nietzschean übermensch and the markedly accelerated
development of civilized culture towards a prophesied future condition.

> “Fascist ideology had two goals by which Fascism's performance may
> reasonably be judged: the creation of a heroically moral human being,
> in a heroically moral social order, and the accelerated development of
> industry, especially in backward economies like Italy.
>
> The fascist moral ideal, upheld by writers from Sorel to Gentile, is
> something like an inversion of the caricature of a Benthamite liberal.
> The fascist ideal man is not cautious but brave, not calculating but
> resolute, not sentimental but ruthless, not preoccupied with personal
> advantage but fighting for ideals, not seeking comfort but
> experiencing life intensely. The early Fascists did not know how they
> would install the social order which would create this "new man," but
> they were convinced that they had to destroy the bourgeois liberal
> order which had created his opposite.
>
> Even as late as 1922 it was not clear to Fascists that Fascism, the
> "third way" between liberalism and socialism, would set up a
> bureaucratic police state, but given the circumstances and fundamental
> Fascist ideas, nothing else was feasible. Fascism introduced a form of
> state which was claustrophobic in its oppressiveness. The result was a
> population of decidedly unheroic mediocrities, sly conformists scared
> of their own shadows, worlds removed from the kind of dynamic human
> character the Fascists had hoped would inherit the Earth.” ^[12]^

A communique written by Anton Long, the pseudonymous leader of the
modern Order of Nine Angles posits similar goals: “First and most
importantly, Satanism is a means whereby individuals may enhance their
own evolution by developing their latent abilities—their vitality,
perception, consciousness and knowledge as well as their Occult
faculties, and such a Way of method is organized for the benefit of
individuals over centuries...Second, Satanism encourages...the evolution
of our species, since it is a fundamental axiom of Satanist philosophy
that every individual possesses the potential to be divine, to achieve
far more than they ever realize.” ^[13]^

Though these occult societies and fascist theory share objectives, the
political means by which these objectives have been sought after has
historically been proven detrimental to results. It seems unlikely that
current occult leaders are not aware of this fact, and so the continued
romanticization of fascism may be simply a symbolic adoption of a
paradigm for consciousness alteration, a practice thoroughly explored in
Chaos Magick. Anton Long suggests that this is the case, writing in
another communique that “in one important respect Satanism may be
regarded as catharsis—a means whereby individuals may divest themselves
of those limiting roles that are often (but not always) the creation of
the ethos of the society in which the individuals find
themselves...Satanic catharsis is essentially blasphemy, but one ordered
and with a definite aim—it results from an individual will channelled by
a conscious understanding. It is this application of will which marks
the genuine Satanist from the imitation or failure. A Satanist revels in
life—the failures find themselves trapped by their own conscious desires
which they do not have the intelligence to understand nor the will to
direct. Blasphemy is only effective if it is, firstly a genuine shock
and reaction to those values which though accepted are often
unconsciously accepted, and secondly an appreciation of the positive and
life-enhancing qualities inferred by infernal opposition. Thus, while
the traditional Black Mass is still powerful because of the continuing
constraints of Nazarene [Judeo-Christian] beliefs, it is often
supplemented today by a Mass which in its unexpurgated version
represents a shocking blasphemy for the majority of people in Western
Countries...One of the most shocking Satanic Masses used by Satanist
groups today is based on an evokation of Adolf Hitler—and not as
something artificial, still less as a psychological 'game,' but rather
as a genuine identification with the positive aspect of
National-Socialist philosophy. (To most readers this, of course, will be
blasphemy, outrageous—which is exactly the point.)...At its highest
level Satanism uncovers what the ethos of a particular society has
covered up through images, dogma, words and ideas, returning the
individual to the primal chaos out of which opposites were formed. This
uncovering gives the individual control, an awareness of their unique
Destiny, and it is the purpose of genuine Satanic groups to foster such
uncovering by blasphemous rites and individual guidance. Beyond such
uncovering, conventional magick, and ritual itself, ceases, replaced by
the profoundest empathy. What C.G. Jung called 'individuation' is
similar to this empathy, but individuation is itself only a beginning.
Satanic Orders enhance evolution—while the majority of people sleep,
fearful of such internal terrors.” ^[14]^

If these elements of fascism within the occult are interpreted merely as
theatrical paradigm inversions, this is simply a play on ideas, not
harmful unless the individual occultist is too moronic to recognize it
as symbolism. The temporary adoption of such taboo paradigms for
psychological therapeutic purposes can also be seen within the BDSM
community in the utilization of Master/slave and parent/child sexual
fetishes to overcome trauma. Of course slavery and child abuse are
wrong, just as fascism is wrong, and no intelligent participant in these
activities would ever actually believe otherwise. It could be argued
that the use of taboos is itself harmful by propagating negative
ideological forms through symbolism, and then counter-argued that
censorship of acts which break taboos merely because some dolt might be
watching would abbreviate intellectual development to the lowest common
denominator.

Therefore, modern occult groups which appear to be fascist are probably
not such, but highly intellectualized individuals using extremist
symbolism to psychologically reprogram themselves. Actual politics
within these groups could vary to any degree, because the group itself
is not political.
