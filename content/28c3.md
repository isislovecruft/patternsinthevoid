I'm going to be traveling abroad for about six weeks, so anyone who is
trying to contact me during this period should know that it may take a
while to get back to you. I'm going to the [Chaos Computer Club's
28c3][], so I'll post updates on things that I learn there. I also
believe that I will be giving a short talk on the artificial
intelligence work I've been involved in.

I'll be getting a German SIM card when I get off the plane in Berlin,
and I'll probably not post the new number here, or maybe I will.
Normally I'm worried about people tracking me down, but hey, why not --
it's a throwaway SIM afterall. It's not like anyone's going to stalk me
all across Europe.

After Germany, I'll be in Austria, Denmark, Czech, Sweden(?), The
Netherlands, and maybe a few other countries. I want to mention that the
only reason someone as poor as I is able to go all these places is due
to a couple of [amazing][] [hackers][] at [Noisebridge][] in San
Francisco, who felt like I should be able to go, provided tons of
support, help, and encouragement. Their only request for me was that one
day I "pay it forward."
