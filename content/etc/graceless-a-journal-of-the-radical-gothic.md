[![][]][]I'm very proud (and very late, due to security issues) to
announce that the first issue of [Graceless][] has been released. We are
an international collective producing a printed and online journal of
the radical gothic. Printed copies are available [here][], or if you
know me IRL you can just ask me for a copy on the cheap. Or, as cheap as
it gets, you can download the online version [here][1]. Also, I will be
tabling copies at the 2011 [San Francisco Anarchist Bookfair][].
