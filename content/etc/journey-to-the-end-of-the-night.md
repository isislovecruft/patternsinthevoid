In Berlin, on New Year's Eve, I participated in a race through the
streets of Berlin, called Journey to the End of the Night -- except this
one, being at the end of the year, is called [Journey to the End of the
Year][]. The rules: run through six checkpoints in order, complete a
challenge at each one, and don't get caught by the chasers or lose your
armband.

I formed a running team with [an Italian hacker who works on Tor][], and
his friend from Greece who is also a hacker. They showed up thirty
minutes late (for which the organizers, my friends [from Vienna][] and
[San Francisco][], postponed the race) with a backpack full of
explosives. Let me tell you: Berliners take their fireworks *very
seriously*, and firework safety inversely so. It's not uncommon at all
for a complete stranger to throw the equivalent of a quarter stick of
dynamite *at your face*. Also, I noticed that Berliners like to
surprise you by throwing bottles and chairs.

So, armed to the teeth with explosives, we set out running through the
streets with others chasing us. Because there was a joke rule that my
friend Redbeard's beard was a safe zone, I ended up having to kidnap him
from a checkpoint by aiming explosives at the other participants in the
race, and a few of the organizers too. Redbeard is awesome. He's a
professional kernel hacker with a red beard down to his waist, if the
later wasn't obviously by the name. I also had to dodge the
aforementioned chairs, bottles, and fireworks with parkour while wearing
a tinfoil hat. And at the end of it all, I found myself at [C-Base][], a
hackerspace built into the remains of a two-millenia-old alien spaceship
crash], discussing DIY soldering iron buttprobes, theoretical physics,
and hackers on sailboats, while drinking Chink Chank Chunk (Club Mate
with sugar, lime, vodka).

Oh Berlin, how I want to live in you!
