<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Since I believe in changing my name whenever I feel like it, I'm doing so
again. From here until I decide to do so yet again, my name is isis agora lovecruft.
(In order to pay homage to H.P. Lovecraft, Ada Lovelace, Agorism, and
the really deep-down OCD-ish satisfaction that I get from syllable
repetition.) Oh, and "cruft" is
[h4x0r jargon](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/C/cruft.html) for "extraneous bullshit".

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Also, because I'm not really writing about anything that matters, and I
haven't gotten a chance to say this yet: Janelle Monae is my hero. I don't
normally listen to pop, but the "Many Moons" music video caught and kept my
rapt attention. I'm not going to get all into analysing it, but Monae manages
to combine critiques of gender politics, race/class relations, and state
capitalism, with an aesthetic sense that *could actually be called cool*, and,
not to mention, hotter feet than Michael Jackson on speed. Oh, and, as if this
video weren't awesome already, Janelle also included gender bending (check out
that handsome tux), nods to classic science fiction, and the theme of
android/cyborg rights. Fuck yeah!
