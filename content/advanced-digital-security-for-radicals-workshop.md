Some friends of mine and I are going to do another community workshop on
the 29th of May at the Black Rose Infoshop. Here's the flyer!

The last workshop we did covered the basics: encrypting emails and chat,
and using Tor. This workshop will cover a teensy bit more advanced
topics, and it's leading up to the next one which will be on DDoSing
techniques and tools and online activism. If you missed the first
workshop, but feel reasonably comfortable with the basics, or you just
want to hang around and listen, you should stop by. Everyone's more than
welcome to attend -- our aim is to help our fellow activists regardless
of where they're at. Come on by, and bring your questions and computers!
