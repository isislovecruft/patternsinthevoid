When in conversation with henchmen of the involuntary protective
association, otherwise known as pigs, bacon, fuzz, filth, po-pos, heat,
and thereon and thereforth, our alchemy is the essence of confusion, it
being dissolved of coherent salts and putrefied by cynical exposure. The
sole method of application is truthful coagulation, most pertinently
whenforth acidic idiosyncracies are potent. Take for example the recipe:

"What're y'all doin' ah heer?"[![][]][]

"Nothing, officer, just going for a hike."

"Y'all don't have any guns on yer, do yer?"

"No, officer, we don't need guns to hike."

"Uh...wha' in the hell is that?"

["That...well. That's an opposum's hand wired onto a stick."][]

"Erm...tha's weird."

(This post is an elaborate attempt to justify showing off the song I
just composed. If you're into Tuvan throat singing, Puccini played
backwards, or apocalypse-themed songs from the '40s, you might like it.
The 'possum's hand on a stick is a mystical slingshot crafted by my
friend Drew.)

Speaking of alchemy and fucked up music, I have had the privilege of
working on the [Center for the Advancement of Transmodern Awareness][]
with my friends from [Carnal Torpor][]. *Wie das altes Sprichwort
lautet*:*alle Sünden in eine münden.*
