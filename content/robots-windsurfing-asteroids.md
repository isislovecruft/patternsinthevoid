[![][]][]China is like *the* punk house of the first world.

Okay, China, your firewall is [so draconian as to be absolutely
silly][]\*\*, and it causes me extra work to send [Tor bridge
addresses][] to your citizens. And your hackers, the ones you scoop up
by the dozen and put on government payrolls simply [to cause havoc for
hackers and activists][] in your own and other countries...yeah. That's
a little annoying. And [your][] [cute][] [little][] [botmaster][] who
has been sending bad requests to my server for the past week or so. Eh,
whatevs.

\*\*The Great Chinese firewall uses a method very [similar to this][].

But I just found out, China, that y'all are [planning to send a robot to
an asteroid to deflect it from a collision course][] with Earth in 2036.
And [how are you going to do that][]? Oh, okay. The robot *is going to
windsurf the asteroid* away from Earth.

I'm willing to forgive the above transgressions, because you just earned
+9000 punk points with that idea. You guys are not a country -- you're a
giant punk house.

    "Hey, China! Can you also turn the asteroid into a chocolate chip cookie? Because that would get you another +9000 punk points."
