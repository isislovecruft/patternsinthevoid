Further anecdotal evidence for my entirely irrational, albeit highly amusing,
affect for feigning belief that I will one day play a part in the invention of
a "time travel" device:

Today, while walking, I decided on whim to take an obnoxious pedestrian
bridge that I have never taken before, simply because it spans about two
hundred feet, has two spirals, is approximately fifty feet high, all *to
cross one lane of traffic*. At the summit of the bridge, between two
pillars, a Ranier Maria Rilke book was hidden. When I picked it up, I
found a page marked. I turned to it. Underlined was the quote: "...the
future enters into us in this way in order to transform itself in us
long before it happens..." Underneath this was written: *Fellow
traveler, the future seeks its child returned!*

I feel like I'm being watched on *so* many different levels.

On a lighter note, there is a new Elk Information Radio Station song,
called "This Is The Solution: To Be Happy With Slaughter" (after the
David Ignatow poem of the same title), in the [Sound][] section.
