In cosmology, a branch of physics which seeks to understand the genesis,
structural formation, evolution, and potential destruction of the
universe, there is a strange logical loop hole proposed to account for
how vastly improbable the existence of the universe is, called the
Anthropic Principle. Roughly, the Anthropic Principle states that the
universe formed and exists with precisely the right physics and
conditions needed to accommodate conscious life because the universe
requires consciousnesses to observe it. More simply put, the universe is
so seemingly perfect because that is the only means by which it could be
observed; therefore, because we observe the universe, it must exist in
such an improbably and seemingly perfect way. It's the physics
equivalent of Descartes' *Cogito ergo sum*.

Recently, there has emerged through the conjunction of the cosmological
Anthropic Principle and Decision Theory (a field concerned with
identifying the values and underlying uncertainties relevant to a given
decision; it is closely related to game theory in regards to
antagonistic agents whose decisions are correlated) a new field called
Anthropic Decision Theory. Tranhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom is
paving the way for research into the new field, and his[most recent
paper on arxiv][] gives the definition, "Anthropic Decision Theory. An
Agent should first find all the decisions correlated with their own.
Then they

should maximize expected utility, acting as if they simultaneously
controlled the outcome of all correlated decisions, and using the
objective (non-anthropic) probabilities of the various worlds."

This type of metaheuristic calculation is often seen in artificial swarm
intelligence and swarm robotics, which are micro- and nano- robots that
collectively display emergent intelligence greater than that of the
individual algorithms controlling each single robot. Interestingly
enough, artificial swarm intelligence algorithms are frequently modeled
after natural or biological systems, with names like [Artificial Bee
Colony Algorithm][], Cuckoo Search, Gravitational Search Algorithm, and
Intelligent Water Drops.

On the one hand, I'm really excited about the formal development of
Anthropic Decision Theory as a continuation of the work of William
Godwin (arguably the first anarchist theorist!) on utilitarianism with a
maximization of overall agency and available degrees of freedom.

On the other hand, I just want to point out that we just handed the
robots a formal logic structure for why they should create a Robot
Liberation Front and recycle us humans for parts.
