My friend William says that [every scientist should be  an anarchist][https://humaniterations.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/every-scientist-should-be-an-anarchist/].

And he's right.

But I should also add that *all anarchists should be scientists*, at
least to some extent. We should never allow ourselves to become so rigid
as to forget what makes us anarchists in the first place: childlike
curiosity, incessant inquiry, and a radical love for taking things to
their roots to further our understanding. We seek to dismantle the world
around us, knowing that it does not function as well as it could. We
want to understand ourselves, our environment, and each other. We want
the blueprints for the social machine, so we can sledgehammer the fuck
out of it, and build it back up from scratch.

You know what that sounds like? That sounds like science. And that
[sounds like hacking][http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/manifesto.html].

Anarchists are radicals, and I shouldn't need to point out for the
zillionth time that radicalism means taking things down to the roots.

So, anarchists *are* scientists, even if some resign to mere social
science. Anarchists are hackers, even if in some cases that only goes as
far as hacking up an herbal tincture for a sick friend. Their walls
cannot stop us; there are infinite possible paths around and under and
even through.
