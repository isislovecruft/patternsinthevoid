Consider the following logical game:

“Two suspects are arrested by the police. The police have insufficient
evidence for a conviction, and, having separated the prisoners, visit
each of them to offer the same deal. If one testifies for the
prosecution against the other (*defects*) and the other remains silent
(*cooperates*), the defector goes free and the silent accomplice
receives the full 10-year sentence. If both remain silent, both
prisoners are sentenced to only six months in jail for a minor charge.
If each betrays the other, each receives a four-year sentence. Each
prisoner must choose to betray the other or to remain silent. Each one
is assured that the other would not know about the betrayal before the
end of the investigation. How should the prisoners act?”

Obviously, the rational choice is not to snitch, and cross your fingers
that your accomplice does the same, right? Well, rationally thinking,
wrong.

If each suspect only cares about minimizing their own jail time, then
the prisoner's dilemma forms a non-zero-sum game. (A zero-sum game is
one in which the total benefits and total losses of all players equal
zero, for instance, if Asimov, Bradbury, and Clarke dumpster a block of
tofu and Bradbury takes a larger piece, the others get less, but the
total benefits and losses is zero. A non-zero-sum game is one in which
the aggregate total gains and losses is not zero, meaning that everyone
will either collectively benefit or collectively suffer together.) In
game theory, the sole concern of each player is maximizing their own
payoff (less jail time), with no concern for the other player's payoff.
The curious Nash equilibrium (i.e. rationalized solution) for this game
is a Pareto-suboptimal solution, that is, rational choice dictates both
players to play *defect*, even though each player's individual reward
would be greater if they both played cooperatively.

As can be seen, each player faces the same choice: 1) 6 months/10 years,
or (2) no time/4 years. Clearly, the second choice is better. Which is
to say that snitching is better. Which doesn't exactly correspond to
actual human behaviour: snitching is the unfortunate exception, not the
rule. It just doesn't sit right at all, mathematically, statistically,
rationally, logically, or otherwise. But then, this is where things get
superrational.

Douglas Hofstadter, in *Metamagical Themas*, proposes that the
conception of rationality that leads “rational” players to defect is
faulty. Instead, Hofstadter posits an alternative rational behaviour,
which he terms “superrational”. Superrational thinking logically leads
to cooperation as follows:

-   Superrational strategy is identical for both players, since both
    players are no longer playing for purely their own benefit, but for
    the benefit of minimizing jail time overall.
-   Therefore, since both players will do exactly the same thing, the
    result lies on the diagonal of the payoff matrix. (Either both will
    defect or both will cooperate.)
-   To minimize jail time from solutions on the diagonal, both players
    cooperate.

Superrational players behave in the following manner:

-   If a superrational player is playing against a known rational
    opponent, they will defect because this minimizes jail time.
-   A superrational player only cooperates with other superrational
    players, whose thinking is correlated with theirs.
-   If a superrational players is playing against another player of
    unknown superrationality, the superrational player will either
    cooperate or defect based on the probability of the another player's
    superrationality.

It is therefore possible to cultivate a group morality which states that
foregoing minimized jail time for oneself in lieu of minimized jail time
overall is the appropriate behaviour. This is the most rational
behaviour, however it is only the most rational so long as the group
morality is maintained. Anarchist and politically radical groups often
support this group morality, and it is essential for all individuals
within these groups to uphold it in order for it to work correctly.
Therefore, snitches, who do not think superrationally, can be considered
as rational opponent players, which is terms for expulsion from the
group (i.e. the true superrational player, or radical, should snitch on
snitches, based on the logical rules outlined above, thus minimizing
jail time.) Even more reason for building trust and a sense of community
among politically radical groups.
