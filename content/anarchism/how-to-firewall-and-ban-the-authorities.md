The folks at [Telecomix][] Crypto Munitions Bureau have put up a list of
[IP addresses of worldwide governments][] and agencies, so that you can
block them through your firewall. If you're running a server or a
domain, you can also modify the .htaccess file to ban these IPs from
accessing your site. You can also force anyone from the above listed IP
addresses, when attempting to connect to your site, to view a static
image instead. I would recommend something which clearly states why they
are not allowed access, for example:

[![][]][]

Details on how to do this modification, and nearly every other
conceivable modification of the .htaccess file, can be found [here][].

Oh, jeepers. This makes me so happy. So. Good.
