<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

[This is an interesting piece](http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/94raven.html)
on what science might look like after an anarchist revolution.

However, it is depressingly 1980s in its perceptions of developing
action within modern scientific theory (specifically the section on
Anarchist Epistemology,
[which states](http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/94raven.html#fn13):

> Paul Feyerabend is the most prominent philosopher to champion a
> different philosophy of science. He criticises the positivist,
> dogmatic approach to knowledge that is common in establishment
> science, in which almost all resources are devoted to exploring the
> implications of the dominant theoretical framework. He supports,
> instead, investigation of a range of competing theories. This is
> called 'anarchist' because there is no central theoretical dogma
> that dictates scientific research.

I'm sorry, and maybe it's just within the physics community, but I would
like to point out that General Relativity and the Standard Model are the
currently accepted theories, while most papers I read are challenges or
modifications to one or the other.

The article also disappoints with its appeals to allow the opinions of
non-scientists to have *as much* weight as those of scientists. Should
the opinions of outside entities count? Yes. Of course. Everyone should
have a say in the development of things which effect the community as a
whole. But -- and I'll apologize again -- sorry,
hippie-bro-dude-number-387-who-smokes-too-much-DMT, you don't fucking
get to tell me about your theory of how Atlantean sacred geometry causes
pressure to equal gravitation. Go sell Hollywood your idea, because I
sure as hell am not interested.

*Ahem.*

There were some positive points, especially the author's
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY --> clear elucidation of the separation of society
and the scientific communities, and how this ideological framework
restricts positive change:
