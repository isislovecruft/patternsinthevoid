Anarcho-transhumanism. Is much better than being a sexist, biological
essentialist.

In fact, as [Will just pointed out, it means sexist and biological
essential arguments lose any grounding they might have had](https://humaniterations.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/the-floating-metal-sphere-trump-card/#respond)
because bodies become the creations of their inhabitors.

> Men are [insert biological essentialist bullshit here],
> and women are [insert more essentialist crap].

But what is a man? And what even is a woman? If our bodies have been
altered beyond recognition, with cybernetic appendages, brain-machine
interfaces, and nanorobotic-enhanced immune systems, can you honestly
continue to make ill-founded claims about the effects of my having a
clitoris? Or what about when I gene-hack my sequences, adding in bits of
exogenic, interspecies, or designer DNA? Are you really going to say
that the person with cephalopodic integument is "more emotional" because
they decided to keep their human vagina? *Please.*
