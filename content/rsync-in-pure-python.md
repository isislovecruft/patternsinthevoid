I quickly modified and packaged a pure Python implementation of the
[rsync algorithm][] today. It's on [Github][] and [PyPi][]. It's going
to be used in the open-source, symmetrically-encrypted,
bandwidth-efficient, cross-platform backup software that I'm writing.
Because why, for fuck's sake, would you trust \*all the files\* on your
computer, plus your cryptographic scheme, and potentially, keys, to a
bunch of capitalist pig-dogs?

I hope other people find this useful, because making Python modules is
totally not as exciting as just coding in Python.

And jetlag FTL: I need to sleep now. And [WTF, America][]: I hate your
[filthy][] [guts][] and I'm leaving ASAFP.
