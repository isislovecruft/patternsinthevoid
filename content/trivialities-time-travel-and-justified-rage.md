This is rather trivial, but I wanted to point out this amazing song by
dark synthpop artist [John Maus][] about killing cops:

And, to make it even better, Maus is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in
Political Philosophy at the European Graduate School in Switzerland. I
really enjoy when other academia come out and directly say that our
current system of hierarchy and oppression is fucked.

And, as if Maus wasn't awesome enough after that, he's also got a song
about time travel, complete with the classic goth
whip-crack-as-a-crash-symbol:
