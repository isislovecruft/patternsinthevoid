A [DIY biohacker][http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/transcending-the-human-diy-style/]
in England, Lepht Anonym, has been experimenting in self-surgury in their (I
use 'they' in the singular sense, as I have noted that they use gender neutral
pronouns in reference to themself on
[their blog][http://sapiensanonym.blogspot.com/]) own kitchen. Anonym has
successfully implanted small metal plates, made of neodymium and encapsulated
in gold and silicon, in nine of their ten fingers, in order to sense
electromagnetic currents.  They call themselves a
["scrapheap transhumanist"](http://hplusmagazine.com/2010/02/11/scrapheap-transhumanism/)
give recommendations on bioproofing materials, used to encase the implants to
prevent chemical reactions like rusting from occurring subcutaneously,
advocating the use of a silicon gel, Sugru, but stating that hot-gun glue
works well, too.

Lepht's current project is based on [Sensebridge's][http://sensebridge.net/]
[Northpaw project][http://sensebridge.net/projects/northpaw/], a wearable
device that provides vibration to give information on the direction of Earth's
magnetic north. Similarly, my friends over at Portland
[Research Club][http://researchclub.posterous.com/] are working on a wearable
system of vibrating sensors which take GPS information from the user's
Smartphone to provide the wearer with an extra-sensory perception of their
friends' locations. Lepht Anonym's project will be to implant an electronic
compass attached to neural-grade electrodes near their left knee. They're
calling the project Southpaw.

I find Lepht's creativity, curiosity, and fearlessness absolutely
inspiring. Instead of the usual (although still admirable) idealistic
theories of transhumanists on the future of converging technologies and
their biological applications, Lepht has taken a more practical
approach: start with what you have, and work from there. “The existing
transhumanist movement is lame. It’s nano everything. It’s just ideas,”
she says. “Anyone can do this. This is kitchen stuff.” Lepht, you are
amazing, and I hope everything works well in your Southpaw project and
all your future endeavours. The world needs more (trans)humans like you!
