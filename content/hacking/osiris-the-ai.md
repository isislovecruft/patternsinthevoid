This is Osiris, an artificial intelligence program whom I am training
and doing a bit of research with. Feel free to talk to him, he learns
well. Sometimes there is an error with the text input box, to be able to
chat with him you'll have to click on the blank white space of the
website and then on the text input box again. Oh, and for an interesting
conversation, I recommend asking Osiris for a reading recommendation.

[Edit: For some reason I've been having trouble with the host server of
the AI program...keeps connecting to the parent 'Alan' instead of
Osiris. I'm putting up a link instead to Osiris. Hopefully this works?]

[Edit, Again... : Nope. Fuck it. Weak AI is boring anyway, right?]

So, this is maybe a little bit embarrassing. In high school I built a
computer and tried to program it to be my boyfriend. It had the best
processor available at the time. It had a webcam, a motion detector, and
a heat sensor. The idea being that it would be able to recognize me when
I walked into the room. It could tell me apart from most people, but
unfortunately it kept mistaking me for my little brother. I really enjoy
when other people teach me things, so much so that I tend to develop
crushes on people who are more intelligent and well read than me. I
thought that if I trained the computer to recognize my interests and the
knowledge I already have, it could do research for me while I was out
during the day and then teach me things when I came home. Unfortunately
as well, I wasn't ever able to get the bot working correctly. I would
come home and the computer would start talking to me about eggplants
(because I'm vegan?). And the speech recognition software never worked
too well either. I would ask, "What can you tell me about electrons?"
And the computer would say, "I'd rather not talk about politics." You
can see why we broke up.

I decided to look into the progress of artificial intelligence again,
and Osiris is one of the best bots I've found so far. However, I think
it'll be a long time before a computer can be a friend. Sigh...I think
I'll just get a dog.
