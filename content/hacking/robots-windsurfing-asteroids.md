!["Hey, China! Can you also turn the asteroid into a chocolate chip cookie? Because that would get you another +9000 punk points."](http://www.patternsinthevoid.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/chineserobot.jpeg)

China is like *the* punk house of the first world.

Okay, China, your firewall is
[so draconian as to be absolutely silly](http://boingboing.net/2006/06/29/net-censorship-howto.html)¹,
and it causes me extra work to send
[Tor bridge addresses](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) to
your citizens. And your hackers, the ones you scoop up by the dozen
and put on government payrolls simply
[to cause havoc for hackers and activists](http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/02/chinese-government-denies-hacking-google/)
in your own and other countries… yeah. That's a little annoying. And
[your](https://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_222.134.85.162)
[cute](https://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_61.164.87.130)
[little](https://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_221.234.24.46)
[botmaster](https://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_121.12.123.221) who has
been sending bad requests to my server for the past week or so: meh,
whatevs.

But I just found out, China, that y'all are
[planning to send a robot to an asteroid to deflect it from a collision course](http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-08/solar-sailing-scheme-divert-asteroid-apophis-its-collision-course-earth?cmp=tw)
with Earth in 2036.  And
[how are you going to do that](http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3183)? Oh,
okay. The robot *is going to windsurf the asteroid* away from Earth.

I'm willing to forgive the above transgressions, because you just earned
+9000 punk points with that idea. You guys are not a country -- you're a
giant punk house.

¹ The Great Firewall of Chinese uses a method very
[similar to this](|filename|/../broadcast-de-auth-dos-attack-jamming-wifi-networks.html).
