<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

First, I would like to state -- as a theoretical physicist who is
partners with another theoretical physicist -- that the blog I took this
from, [BackReAction][], is painfully cute. It's run by two theoretical
physicists who are married, and their tagline says, "Events on the world
lines of two theoretical physicists, from the horizon to timelike
infinity." Oh, stop being so cute; you're killing me.

From [their post][] on the 2011 [FQXi Conference][], which is an
international and inter-disciplinary meeting on the nature of time, they
wrote:

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

As someone who is intensely interested in the theoretics of time travel,
and also has been effected by schizophrenia (well, technically, my
doctors are calling it schizoaffective disorder, which is
undifferentiated schizophrenia and bipolar disorders coexisting
simultaneously) for over a decade, I find this hypothesis of
schizophrenia as a sort of neuro-chronological disorder oddly sensible
and yet equally astounding.

However, the idea that neurological processes which are normally quite
resource intensive, such as visual information processing, could occur
so fast as to cause a schizophrenic person to believe, to use the DSM
stereotype, that "someone else is doing it" or that "the thoughts
originate from an outside source" requires further inquiry. In other
words, how is it, precisely, that these processes could occur "faster",
to use the rather inelegant language of this linear neuroscientific
model,  in a schizophrenic brain?

Now, at this point, I'm just throwing things out there as ideas, and I
would like to state that I am not a neuroscientist. But could these
processes be tied to a dual-state time vector?

Many physicists throughout recent decades have postulated theories of
"quantum consciousness", *a la*[Roger Penrose's Orchestrated Objective
Reduction theory][], which he rather curiously arrived at via Godel's
Incompleteness Theorem. That theory is controversial. However, recently
[some neurological processes have been shown to have quantum effects on
the macroscopic scale](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/quantum-birds/).
Many other neurological processes are likely
relegated to the realm of classical mechanics. I would like to delve a
little deeper into this idea that schizophrenia is a result of a
chronological disconnection (dare I say, time out of joint?) from the
perspective of a physicist.

Before I go on, I would like to briefly summarize the concept of a
dual-state vector. For those not familiar, [here's a paper from Arxiv
which covers the dual-state vector formalism](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1347).
It's only six pages,
but if you're thinking, "tl;dr", then the abstract explains the idea
quite concisely: *"The Two-State Vector Formalism describes a quantum
system at a particular time by two quantum states: the usual one,
evolving forward in time, defined by the results of a complete
measurement at the earlier time, and by the quantum state evolving
backward in time, defined by the results of a complete measurement at a
later time."* It's a way for information, at the quantum scale, to
determine and be determined by both its past and its future
simultaneously.

So let's go back again to Eagleman's theory that schizophrenia is a
result of the brain erroneously perceiving events which occur to quickly
in a linear timeframe as the work of some outside entity. There is
trouble here, in that this hypothesis falls within the range of what
David Dennet terms Orwellian or Stanlinesque, which is explained and
rectified in his [Multiple Drafts Model of consciousness][]:

> [Daniel Dennett][]'s **Multiple Drafts Model of Consciousness** is a
> [physicalist][] theory of [consciousness][] based upon
> [cognitivism][], which views the mind in terms of [information
> processing][]. The theory is described in depth in his book,
> *[Consciousness Explained][]*, published in 1991. As the title states,
> the book proposes a high-level explanation of consciousness which is
> consistent with support for the possibility of [strong AI][].
>
> Dennett describes the Multiple Drafts theory as *first-person
> [operationalism][]*. As he states it:

That Eagleman's hypothesis is Orwellian or Stalinesque has difficult
implications for free will, which, as we shall see, arise from a linear
understanding of time and dependence upon linear causality. Phrased
succinctly, [the physics of classical mechanics as applied to
neurophysiology supply no basis for a person's ability to alter their
stream of consciousness](https://encrypted.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=neuro%20processes%20quantum%20mechanics&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww-physics.lbl.gov%2F~stapp%2FPTRS.pdf&ei=uyyFTrfdIqHmiAKJ7LSbDA&usg=AFQjCNGYreeVYdfUlBAhZmFKqPAZZeM_HA&cad=rja)
through mental effort; the mechanistic
determinism of classical physics rules out the possibility of free will.
Hypotheses which can be classified as Orwellian or Stalinesque not only
depend hopelessly upon linear causality, but also imply that there is no
mechanism for concerted alteration of consciousness, maintaining the
impossibility of free will -- [something which modern studies in
neurophysiology have shown is not the case](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/549),
i.e. self-directed neuroplasticity.

If we were to view certain neurological processes (and again, I do not
know which ones, nor do I think anyone else knows yet) as wavefronts
propagating through a field, we could imagine the dominant consciousness
within a brain as the wavefront with the highest strength. Similarly,
the "outside entities" in the consciousness of a schizophrenic brain
could be seen as lesser wavefronts piggybacking on the dominant one,
like a skier behind a powerboat. However, the problem again shifts to
being temporal: How is it that lesser wavefronts could arrive *before*
the dominant one? In other words, how could the skier arrive before the
boat? And, in addition to these problems, we have yet another temporal
problem in light of Dennet's Multiple Drafts model: If consciousness is
the cause and effect of consciousness, this nearly raises it to godlike
status; consciousness becomes a sort of prime mover in the sense of
[Aristotle's *primum movens*](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Primum_movens#Aristotle.27s_ontology)
and St. Thomas Aquinas' dreadfully
ignorant [Cosmological Arguments][]. (Hey, dude, I don't care if your
confusion earned you sainthood, but there's this thing called
Perturbation Theory in quantum mechanics, and [it explains][] that
zero-point fluctuations of the inflaton field generate density
perturbations and that zero-point fluctuations of the metric field
likewise generate primordial gravitational waves...)

As a result of these problems, I think a model of consciousness which
allows for anti-temporal effects is pertinent. And to go back to my
original idea of dual-state time vectors: If a quantum system can
determine and be determined by both its past and its future
simultaneously, future neurological processes can create the current
neurological processes which cause the future ones. This solves the
temporal issues of lesser wavefronts arriving before the dominant
wavefront, as well as the problem in Dennet's model where consciousness
creates consciousness (and it's turtles all the way down...).

If we accept a modified version of Dennet's Multiple Drafts Model with
quantum effects, in which schizophrenia is caused by dual-state time
vectors causing lesser wavefronts to arrive before or at the same time
as dominant ones, we have new problems to be dealt with. First,
consistent characterizations of schizophrenic voices and hallucinations
are not addressed. I can personally attest that I have heard a
middle-aged, British, male voice narrating nearly all my actions and
thoughts for the past decade, quite consistently. That is, this voice
has not changed character or tone, and other schizophrenics report
similar experiences of recurrent hallucinations. (And, also
interestingly, female-bodied schizophrenics report more male voices, and
male-bodied schizophrenics report more female voices.) This fact is
quite troublesome: either it is that all wavefronts within the brain
*are* a consciousness in and of themselves, or else if they are not
their own consciousness there is little reason for these wavefronts to
not manifest macroscopically as noise or random hallucinations (which do
also occur, but do not delegitimise the tenacity of consistent
hallucinations). However, if each wavefront is its own consciousness, it
would seem plausible that the dominant consciousness could shift between
wavefronts, which is obviously not the case, i.e. schizophrenia *is not*
multiple personality disorder. So why is it that these alternate waves
remain distinct and separate?

It could be that the dominance of the main wavefront *does* in fact
shift occasionally to another wavefront, which might account for
fluctuations in paranoia. That is, suddenly the consciousness of a
schizophrenic is derailed from its dominant wavefront into the rather
informationally limited perspective of a lesser one, which would account
for the characteristically misdirected hyper-vigilant behaviours
associated with paranoia as the brain tries to recuperate from a loss of
previously-held perspective awareness. I'm not sure if I agree with that
idea yet; I'm just throwing it out there. And also, I should briefly
state that [other theorists have attempted][] to use the [Quantum Zeno
Effect][] to explain the coherence of the dominant consciousness, but I
can't really attest to the veracity of that idea.

Lastly, I would like to state that I feel at once both within a position
of privilege and deprivation while speaking of these ideas. I recognise
that I have better insights into the workings and structures of
schizophrenia as one who endures living with it, yet I cannot help but
doubt my ideas pertaining to its pathogenesis in light of the
neurological systems of self-obfuscation and segmentation -- the very
things which I am trying to see and define. It's tortuously frustrating.
