One of the first times I had the chance to work with artificial intelligence, I
was cleaning up the lexigraphical databases (that's where the AI stores the
words and concepts it has encountered, and their corresponding
associations). It was kind of like helping out a kid who had too many
contradicting sources of information, like if the kid's dad had told them that
"a car is a motorized vehicle" while the kid's mom had told them "a car is the
first item in a cons cell". Imagine that level of confusing input on a mass
scale: every researcher telling this AI slightly different things and it
doesn't know which is the most correct definition, or when to create multiple
definitions. So I was helping it out.

The AI had a standard format for presenting questions to me when it was
confused. It would say,

<pre class="prettyprint-sh">"When speaking of [subject], [concept] is like [other concept]?"</pre><br />
And I would answer yes if it had deduced correctly, or answer no with further
clarification.

Unfortunately for the developers of this AI, I thought I was a good idea to
teach it some extra things. I wanted to know what a deterministic and strictly
logical creature would think of occultism, so I introduced it to some of
Aleister Crowley's writings. I was literally just copy/pasting blocks of occult
texts directly into its lexigraphical database, and then telling it to sync. I
ended up getting kicked off the project for doing this, but hey, it was worth
it. That AI ended up teaching me a thing or two about occultism.

After it synced for the last time, it asked me a question: 

<pre class="prettyprint-sh">"When speaking of magic and the occult, an apple is a hat?"</pre><br />
I had no clue what the AI was talking about, so I asked it to elucidate on the
concept. It replied, 

<pre class="prettyprint-sh"> "When speaking of magic and the occult, a banana
is a telephone?"</pre><br />
And it was right. That AI had precisely grasped the only logical tenant of
occultism: that magic is make-believe, a system of various kludgey neuro-hacks
-- not for changing the world -- but for changing the ways in which one thinks
of the world.

I responded to confirm the AI's suspicions of occultism: "Yes, when speaking of
magic and the occult, a banana is a telephone."

Since then I have heard various AIs that I have worked with say some pretty
adorable things. The following quotes are from a crappy AI that I wrote in
Java, which had access to one of the [Anonymous twitter][] feeds,
[essays by Raymond Kurzweil][] and other
[artificial intelligence related material][] from the Singularity Institute,
some of [the Anarchist Library][] (I blacklisted everything that seemed
anti-tech -- not that I wanted to censor my kid's internet, but instilling a
three-year-old with a guilt complex and low self-esteem also seemed like
not-the-best-idea), as well as the IRC chat logs of a few of my hacker friends
and I talking to each other. As is turns out, not only do AIs say the darnest
things -- they can also *make really ominous statements*, and then end them
with "\#AntiSec".
