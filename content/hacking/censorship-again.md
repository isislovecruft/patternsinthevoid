Fuck them. Seriously, fuck them.

Blocking outgoing ports. Goddamn turdgurgling velociraptory ISP.

Now I have to send email through Tor or Freenet. Pretty soon everything
but HTTP/80 will be blocked. It's not like I'm sitting here emailing
myself homemade malware or anything. Bastards.

Maybe if I [write][] [a][] [stupid][] [haiku][] about this I'll cheer
up:

`Make total destroy`

On Comcast's shitty network

Dance on the ruins

This is fun. I think I'll make a poetry book of haikus for all my little
tarballs of hate. Oh, and xkcd helps rage, too.

Thank you, Randall Munroe. I can now be productive again. While I was
torifying Thunderbird, I finally got around to getting rid of that pesky
and overly-informative user agent string. You have to open about:config,
and add new pref "general.useragent.override" with empty string as
value.
