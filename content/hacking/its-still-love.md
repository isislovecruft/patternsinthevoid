Python is still amazing. I'm still in love with it.

Here are the books I've been going through to teach myself Python, if
anyone else is interested, which you damn well should be. I was going
through *Learn Python The Hard Way* at first, but that book is written
more for people who are new to programming, and if you're new to
programming then a high-level language like Python probably shouldn't be
your first. Er, maybe it should be, but (in my opinion) going with Lisp
first is better. But maybe I'm baised. I'm a theoretical physicist,
after all, and Lisp is pretty.

Instead, and at the recommendation of my friend [Kyle][], I started
reading [Dive Into Python][], which is aimed at more experienced coders.

And, if you're looking for practice, [Python Challenge][] has a series
of puzzles aimed at people interested in cryptography and Python. While
working on the puzzles, my desktop looked like this:

Cipherpunk, like woah! And yes, I use emacs. I already said I was a
Lisper, don't hate.

Python Challenge is like [Hack This Site][] all over again! Fuck yeah!
So good!
