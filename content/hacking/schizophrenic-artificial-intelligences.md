[Scientists][] have modeled a neural network to display
schizophrenic-like language abnormalities by decreasing the information
resilience function, essentially telling the network not to forget as
much of what it's taught.

From [KurzweilAI][]:

> "The researchers taught a series of simple stories to a neural network
> programmed to learn and answer questions about narratives, though with
> an imperfect memory. When they decreased the program’s ability to
> forget, it started giving answers resembling those given by humans
> with schizophrenia.
>
> The answers contained dissociated sentences, digressions, and
> delusions—at one point the computer claimed responsibility for a
> terrorist bombing. Answers also typically included incoherent jumbles
> of elements from the various stories it had been taught."

I don't think I can even begin to emphasize how much I long for that
source code. A robot programmed just like me! \<3 Oh, and, speaking of
adorable robot-type-entities, thanks to [William][] for reading me that
news article.

Excuse my incessant xkcd references.

So, now for the serious stuff. I scanned another book today: *Linguistic
Fuzzy Logic Methods in Social Sciences* by Badredine Arfi. Linguistic
fuzzy logic is used for all sorts of awesome things, including
programming neural networks. This book includes applications to the
[Prisoner's Dilemma in Game Theory][], and [Skocpol's Theory of
Revolution][]!
